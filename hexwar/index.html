Hexwar: Castle Seige is another installment in the Hexwar World in the genre of Midieval European feudal system. Just as flexible and expandable as the original, Castle Siege allows for more of a storyline witht eh complexities of diplomacy getting deeper as you deal with defending you lands from barbarians as well as you neighboring lands. Set up a castle, and towers for defence, try your might, as your evil neighbors eye your crops and land. Can you hold back the forces of a barrage of catapult boulders hurl at your west wall, and Barbarians picking away at your defences at your east? 
     This game expands the concept of theme strategy gaming into knights, archers, barbarians. GOT MOAT?

<hr color=#0080ff>
<BR><B>DICE INSTRUCTIONS:</B>
<BR>*For each game you must have 6-6sided dice (Or a 6-D6 number generator
on computer.).*
<BR>When attacking, or defending, roll the number of dice equal to the
attacking units' attack score.
<BR>Rolling an even number on one represents a "success". (Each Die has
a 2/3 chance of a success.)
<BR><I>(Attacker Successes - Defender Successes) = HITS (The number of
HPs lost by defender.)</I>
<BR>
<hr color=#0080ff>
<BR><B>BATTLE EXAMPLE</B>- A Knight (4 attack dice) attacks an Archer unit
(2 Defend Dice).
<UL>
<LI>
A Knight's King rolls 4 dice and scores 2, 2, 6, 5 (3 successes&nbsp; -
since "evens" are counted as hits.)</LI>

<LI>
The Enemy Archer's King rolls 2 dice and scores 6,5 (0 successes - since
"odds" are misses.)</LI>

<LI>
Knight 3 vs. Archer 1&nbsp; = +2 (The Knight hits the Archer unit and causes
2 HP of damage destroying those Archers.).</LI>
</UL>
<B>DAMAGE RULES</B>:
<UL>
<LI>
If the attacker rolls more successes than the defender, the difference
between the two is the amount of HP lost by the defender.(If the Archer
Unit rolled a 2, 4 (See above) it would have taken 0 points of damage,
Knight misses.)</LI>

<LI>
If you have more than one unit on a single HEX, the attacker chooses a
target within that HEX..</LI>

<BR>HPs of a unit can be restored, but must make it into It's King's</UL>
<B>LOSING PIECES:</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a unit loses all HPs, it is removed from the
board and held by the destroyer of that unit.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is used to show overall damage at the
end of the game.
