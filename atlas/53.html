<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Earthquakes are one
of the most common (hundreds occurring every day according to John Sumner) and
most destructive natural disasters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

Francisco) and are very unpredictable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This is no warning with an earthquake as compared to a hurricane or
other natural disaster...only a horrible aftermath.<span style="mso-spacerun:

seismologists, and even they are unable to answer many of them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our group was not given the task of solving
an unanswered problem though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our
question is why earthquakes on the East Coast that have the same magnitude as
those on the West Coast are much more damaging to a much larger area.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From our research, we concluded that the
three factors that most dramatically cause earthquakes on the East Coast to be
more damaging than those on the West Coast are:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>preparation, structures, and geology.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In order to gain an understanding of the research done in this
atlas, one must first have a basic knowledge of earthquakes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>One reason that
the West Coast receives much less damage from earthquakes than does the East
Coast is preparation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The United States
has many seismology centers scattered throughout it (Assessing Earthquakes pp.
25-27).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These centers study the
earthquakes that happen in the United States and use the information that they
obtain to harness a better understanding of these tremendous phenomenons.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The seismologists can learn about the
movement of the tectonic plates as well as pinpoint the epicenter of these
earthquakes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This information allows
them to provide cities with important information to help them prepare for
earthquakes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The reason that this
research helps the West Coast more than the East Coast is that there are many
more earthquakes in the West Coast (Coffman pp. 1-3).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Since there are many more earthquakes on the West Coast, there are
many more centers to study earthquakes located in these areas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Appoximately
40% of these centers are located in California and Nevada.<span
style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@ </span>(Assessing Earthquakes
pp.25-27)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The East Coast, on the other
hand, has very few of these centers and does not receive near as accurate
information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a matter of fact, they
have so few centers located in the Eastern United States, that it is difficult
for the seismologists to report all the specifics of some earthquakes...such as
where the epicenter is located exactly and some other exact technical information.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Due to the lack of centers on the East
Coast, the residents of these areas often have absolutely no warning, and this
leads to many deaths that could have been prevented if there were more
seismology centers located in the Eastern United States.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is one reason why the East Coast
receives more damage from earthquakes than does the West Coast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another reason why
earthquakes on the East Coast are more devastating than those on the West Coast
are the structural advancements in the West Coast.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Because the cities on the West Coast encounter earthquakes much
more frequently than those on the East Coast, they have to adjust the structure
of their buildings to avoid constant reconstruction (quake.wr.usgs.gov).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those cities on the East Coast experience so
few earthquakes that it would be less expensive just to rebuild when an
earthquake actually did happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is
why an earthquake at a magnitude of 6.0 would not cause near as much structural
damage in a West Coast city as it would an East Coast city.<span

<div class=Section5>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The last and most
influential factor that makes earthquakes more devastating on the East Coast is
the geology of the land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The area
affected by earthquakes depends mainly on the amount of rock within that area.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The area west of the Rocky Mountains is
composed of densely compacted rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Most of the areas east of the Rocky Mountains contains more sediment and
sand than rock (Sumner pp. 52-53).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What
this means is that an earthquake on the West Coast (even though it has an equal
magnitude as one on the East Coast) will not affect near as much of the
surrounding area as one on the East Coast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The dense rock will absorb the shock of the earthquake and therefore
will not allow it to travel very far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>On the East Coast, an earthquake of equal magnitude will affect much
more of the surrounding area because there is not as much rock to absorb the
shock...basically a jello effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For
example:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Two earthquakes of similar
magnitude were recorded, one in the St. Lawrence River region, and one in
Pleasant Valley, Nevada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The earthquake
that occurred in the St. Lawrence River region had a magnitude of 7.0 on the
Richter Scale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This earthquake was felt
in approximately 2 million square miles of land extending to <span
style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>A</span>Eastern Canada, south to Virginia,
and west to the Mississippi River<span style='font-family:"WP TypographicSymbols"'>@</span>
(Coffman 10).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The earthquake in Nevada
was a 7 and 3/4 on the Richter Scale,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>yet it only affected 500,000 square miles (Coffman 152).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This earthquake, even though of larger
magnitude, affected much less area and caused substantially less damage than
the earthquake in the St. Lawrence region.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This type of example can be shown repeatedly throughout history (Coffman
pp.1-3).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In conclusion, our
group discovered that earthquakes on the East Coast, even though they are of
the same magnitude, are more devastating than those on the West Coast because
of preparation, structural advancements, and geology.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We also gained a much better general understanding of how
earthquakes happen, and how man can attempt to deal with them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Now we can go home and tell grandma
all about earthquakes and why they are worse on the East Coast compared to the
West Coast.</p>
