<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	The text is to be
submitted in 12 point type, Times New Roman font, with paper margins
of one inch on all sides and double spaced. For the draft, one
printed copy will be submitted for review. For the final submission,
two hard (printed) copies must be submitted as well as one electronic
copy (on disk). The disk must have a label indicating the group name,
title, assignment, date and group member names. Remember to <U>staple
your report</U>. All electronic submission must be in PC Windows
Microsoft Word and/or Excel and/or ArcView. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Pay particular attention
to the citations (see &#147;Guide to citing sources for Geography
1305&quot;in your syllabus). The intent is to take these research
projects and place them on the UCA Geography department&#146;s web
page. In other words, once published, anyone will be able to view
these reports. So, be careful about citing your sources. By the same
token, do not make your report a lengthy string of quotes. No more
than 20 words should be used in a single quote. Paraphrase when
necessary, put the material in your own words as much as possible.
The Writing Center has a number of handouts on how to cite materials.
Please note that if you are directly citing a web site in your text
that you should provide the abbreviated link in the text (e.g.,
http:\www.theatlantic.com) and the full citation including title in
your reference section. Internet web site citations should give the
reader information on who is sponsoring or writing the material. If
you are attaching maps or illustrations to your report, they should
be referenced and discussed in the text. Do not let them simply hang
off the back of the report.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Every word processing
program has a spell check feature. Use it. Drafts and finals
submitted with misspelled words will be given a zero (1/5 of your
grade). At the very minimum have at least one other person proof and
edit your work before you submit it. I will mark down for poor
grammar, organization, etc. Also note that both the draft and the
final must be reviewed by the Writing Center and a Center slip must
be attached to the draft or final. For the final submission, the page
from the draft with my comments must also be submitted. </FONT>
