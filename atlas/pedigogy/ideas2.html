<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Updated: 3/5/2000</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Atlas #2, Human Geography
and/or Mapping</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>B. HUMAN GEOGRAPHY:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>B.1. Demographics
(fertility, mortality and migration)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. Where do the freshmen
of UCA come from? In-state, and where? Out-of-state, and where.
Foreign, and where? Are there clear in-state migration streams? Is
UCA predominately in-state students? What role do you think the
difference in in-state versus out-of-state tuition might play?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. Conway is booming!
Exploding at the seams! Why? Is it from births or migration? If
migration, then from where, and how much? If current migration or
fertility trends continue, what will Conway&#146;s population be
like?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	3. Death. Everybody does
it. But what do people in this state die from? Have the major causes
of death changed over time? How? Are there major differences in cause
of death by age, sex, income or race? Is there a relationship between
urbanization and rates of death?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	4. Is there a correlation
between level of economic development (incomes) and fertility rates,
i.e., as incomes rise the number of children per family drops, or
vice versa?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	5. What do the population
pyramids look like for Conway versus other cities and the state. What
can you tell about the current population e.g. their age makeup, sex
ratios, future fertility, and what predictions can you make, e.g.
future demands for schools, nursing homes, etc?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>B.2. Cultural Attributes</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. Why don&#146;t
students bicycle <U>on</U> campus? Why don&#146;t students bicycle <U>to</U>
campus? Is it a cultural attitude (Arkansans don&#146;t cycle) or are
most students commuters? Is it because of the lack of bike lanes and
bike racks on campus? Is there a pent up demand for a safe way to
bike to campus?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. Assess the changing
role of men, women and children over the early history of the state
by selecting an old cemetery. Map the location and size of headstones
by sex and age at death. Examine, describe and map the differences.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	3. Have churches
physically migrated over time in Conway or Little Rock. Have churches
physically moved from the center city to be closer to their members
in the suburbs? Or, have new churches broken off from existing
churches to serve those communities? Or do members simply commute
longer distances to the church?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	4. What is the religious
affiliation of people in Conway or Faulkner County, or Little Rock?
Which religion/denomination/sect is the oldest? Which is the biggest?
Are there ethnic differences? Are their race differences? Do any
Native American Indians sects remain?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	5. Trace the migration of
blues music, or folk, or gospel. Where did it start? How did it get
here? What kind of diffusion process played a role?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>B.3. Spatial Behavior</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. The Geography of
Football: From where has UCA recruited its football players for the
last four years. Are there distinct migration streams. Do the coaches
have personal contacts with these high schools?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. What spatial barriers
exist within 4 blocks of the UCA campus that would discourage
alternative transportation (walking, cycling) e.g., lack of
sidewalks, open ditches, lack of designated bike lanes, curb-cuts,
traffic signals, etc. What is the condition of sidewalks near UCA?
Over the last couple years, how and why have UCA parking lots
migrated? Does UCA provide shuttle service or a way to get from these
satellite parking lots? Are there personal safety issues in walking
from campus to satellite parking lots at night?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	3. Is the UCA campus in
full compliance with the Disabilities Act? Is the entire campus
accessible to the disabled?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	4. What are the patterns
concerning signs on UCA&#146;s campus?  Do all buildings have easily
identifiable signs on the exterior? As a newcomer, how easy is it to
navigate around the campus? Could you find specific buildings,
specific room numbers?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	5. Where are most of the
fire alarm calls on campus? How often must they be tested? How often
are they pulled unnecessarily? Are both types spatially clustered in
a particular type of building? Is there a temporal pattern, i.e. more
likely during early evening? Is there a seasonal pattern, i.e. more
likely during mid-terms and finals?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	6. Is UCA the &#147;campus
that took over Conway?&#148; Map out the parcels that UCA owns (you
may be VERY surprised to see how much UCA owns!) around the campus.
Compare it to the &#147;UCA Master Development Plan.&#148; Is all
that land necessary? What will it be used for? Was it expensive to
obtain? Did some alumni make a killing (wink, wink, nudge, nudge)?
All of this is public record, it will just take some digging down at
City Hall, the UCA administration office and the physical plant. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>B.4. Political Geography</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. What impact could UCA
students have on local Conway elections? Is the student body of a
sufficient size? Given the low registration and turnout of voters,
could a fully registered and voting UCA block take over Conway&#146;s
City Council?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. What are the various
political boundaries in Conway (e.g. voting districts, city limits,
water management districts, planning districts, sewer bond districts,
pollution control districts, school districts) and how do they
overlap? What do all these districts do, what are their duties,
responsibilities, and what do they actually visibly do?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	3. Based on election
records, has Conway, or the state of Arkansas become more
conservative or liberal over time? Is there a split between national
and local elections ( e.g. voting for liberal candidates locally,
conservative candidates nationally)?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>B.5. Economic Geography</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. What are the major
industries in Conway? Who are the major employers, and what do they
contribute to the city (taxes, pollution, traffic congestion,
increased commuting or permanent migration)? Do most employees move
to or already live in Conway? What are the major occupations in
Conway?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. As a major employer,
what is UCA&#146;s contribution to the City of Conway, as measured in
taxes (is UCA tax exempt?), pollution, traffic congestion, commuting,
permanent migration)? Do most employees move to or already live in
Conway? What are the major occupations employed by UCA?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	3. As a major magnet for
temporary residents, i.e. students, what is UCA&#146;s contribution
to the City of Conway, as measured in pollution, traffic congestion
(does every student have a car?), commuting (how many student commute
to campus?), permanent migration? In the 2000 U.S. Census will UCA
students be counted as residing in Conway, or at their parent&#146;s
home. Is the UCA student population large enough to make a
difference?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	4. A &#147;high-order
good&#148; such as cars, computers or luxury items needs a large
population to support its sale. A &#147;low-order good&#148;, jeans,
food, paper products, only needs a small population to support it.
What is the population threshold for some goods and services, and how
has that changed since 1985 or 1990. In other works, over the last
five or 10 years how has the ratio of a particular good or store
changed to population in that city. For example, Little Rock had how
many computer stores, per thousand population in 1990 versus today?
How much has that ratio increased. What about other goods, staples
like supermarkets, convenience stores, furniture stores, auto
dealerships, health clubs? Have &#147;Big Boxes&#148; e.g. Home
Depot, Office Depot, Walmart, Best Buy, etc. changed the
relationship? Have their spatial relationship changed, i.e. their
locations from center city to suburbs? Note: Access to old phone book
yellow pages would probably be necessary for this project, either on
CD on hard copy. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	5. Map the diffusion of
Wal-Mart from its humble beginnings to a nationwide chain. Is it
hierarchical or contagious spatial diffusion? How has Wal-Mart
diffused in Arkansas? What effect has the introduction of a Walmart
to a city had on local businesses?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>B.6. Natural Resource
Geography</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. Check out the Green
Map System at http://www.greenmap.com/cities.html. How could we do
something similar for Conway?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. Given that the levy
breaks, what portion of Conway would be underwater during a 100 year
flood. What would be the depth of the water in some of the old and
especially new subdivisions? Would UCA be underwater?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	3. According to soil
maps, what portion of Conway is built on soil that is deemed
unsuitable for urbanization due to its poor drainage? What has Conway
done to address the problems of drainage in the city? What is Conway
doing to prevent future drainage problems as the city grows?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	4. Where are hazardous
materials used, stored, dumped and disposed of on campus? Are we in
any danger from their release, or their old storage? Ditto for
Conway. What is their relationship to the aquifer, or to the storm
drainage system? Could they get into either of those?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>B.7. Urban Geography</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. How are expanding
cities (Conway, Little Rock, etc.) planning to handle future growth?
Do they have plans in place for new schools, roads, sewers, etc., and
how will these services be paid for?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. How have land-uses in
Conway changed over time? Can you predict future land use based on
existing land use? How strict are land use regulations, anyway? How
does land use relate to zoning?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	3. How and why have the
city limits of Conway changed over time? What is involved in being
annexed by the City, and after annexation, what services must the
city provide. Do land owners or developers pay the city (to defer
costs) to be annexed? Can the City refuse annexation? In what
direction is the city growing?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>B.8. Regional Geography</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. Collect and produce an
area profile of the Conway area (city and hinterland). Include
population, sources of growth, projected population, description of
flora, fauna, government and society. How would you fashion a packet
designed to lure new businesses, residents here? </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. Describe the cultural
and economic region controlled by Little Rock. What surrounding
cities feed into it? How does Little Rock relate to these other
smaller cities? For cultural attributes, are most radio stations
located in Little Rock, are the better restaurants located in Little
Rock, are upscale clothing stores located in Little Rock? For
economic attributes, are most stores and businesses supplied from
Little Rock, do service customers go to or come from Little Rock?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>B.9. Socially Constructed
Geography</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. How many gated
communities can be found in Conway? What is their purpose? Are gated
communities (ranging from just a fence or wall to an actual gate and
guard) new in Conway? Are they becoming the norm? Who do the gates
exclude?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. Describe and map
social control districts, i.e. places where behavior is controlled.
These could include; malls, public parks, university campuses, gated
communities, public meeting places, public streets. Where are these
social control districts, who are they trying to control, and why are
they trying to control them?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>C. GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
SYSTEMS (GIS):</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. What is the
availability of maps and blueprints for the UCA campus? What is
available, in what form, for what period to time, etc?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. What is the
availability of maps for the City of Conway? What is available, in
what form, for what period to time, etc? </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	3. Map the transportation
systems in Conway, interstate, primary and secondary roads. Have
Conway&#146;s commercial growth shifted toward the interstate? Where
has Conway&#146;s residential growth shifted?</FONT></P>
