<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>I. Course Description and
Objectives</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	The rationale for this
course derives from the fact that geography is everywhere. Yet people
remain generally ignorant of geography for two reasons. First, they
assume that memorizing all the state capitols is the same as learning
geography. It is not. Rote memorization simply means that we now have
a skeleton of facts on which we can now begin to place the muscles,
organs and all the other cool stuff. The second reason that people
often mis-specify geography is that they are not looking for it. They
have not been sensitized to the geographies of; politics, war,
religion, land forms, culture, gender relations or economics. Once
you have successfully completed this course, you will be able to
literally see geography everywhere. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	The purpose of Geography
1305 is to offer the student a more integrated (holistic) view of the
world in which we live, as well as an understanding of the underlying
processes. The course is concerned with the evolution of the regional
variation on earth, especially as exemplified by humans and their
interaction with the earth. The physical environment, history, and
technological changes all affect this variation and will be combined
with factual descriptions of the present to give us a better
understanding of the world today. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	This particular section
of Geography 1305 rocks. It offers students a unique opportunity,
that of performing research to answer a geographic question of their
choice and publishing those findings on UCA&#146;s World Wide Web
server. Group research projects in this class will be added to the
Arkansas Atlas project, a proposed web-based atlas of geographic
information about Arkansas. Students in this will become published
authors, and, in the process, contribute to the geographic knowledge
about their state, region and world. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Principles of Geography
is a basic survey course that should help all students, regardless of
their majors, to understand the increasingly complex world and its
problems, and probable future. The course objectives are:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	1. To teach the student
to &#147;think geographically.&#148; This means to take into account
fundamental issues such as: assumptions, scale, context and meaning.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	2. To enable the student
to be able to more intelligently discuss and understand basic
interrelationships between societies and their environments;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	3. To gain a better
understanding of the physical processes that affect and change our
planet, as well as how they affect and are affected by human&#146;s
actions;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	4. To enable the student
to better understand non-western cultures; and</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	5. To show how
interdependent the United States is with the rest of the world:
physically, economically and culturally.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>II. Required Text</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The main text for this
course is Bergman and Renwick, 1999. <U>Introduction to Geography:
People, Places and Environment</U>. First edition. (ISBN 0130108200)
for the package, or you may purchase the items separately: (ISBN
013907452X) for the soft-cover text  (013959339X) for the Atlas, and 
(0139237569) for the Study Guide.  Copies of the &#147;used&#148;
text are available at the UCA Bookstore, as well as other bookstores
and Internet-based college text stores. One copy of the text is on
reserve at the UCA library for your convenience because I&#146;m a
nice guy, but I would appreciate it if you didn&#146;t spread that
around since I have a fierce reputation to protect. Additional
outside readings will be introduced during the course. All readings
will be available on reserve in the library. Many will be accessible
on the World Wide Web. Each student is expected to complete all
required readings <U>prior</U> to class. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>III. Lectures</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Approximately half of
class lectures and discussions will be based on this text; the
remainder will be additional outside material. Attendance in lecture
is not required; however, students are responsible for information
covered in lectures whether or not they attend class. This includes
changes in assignments, exams, etc. Students will also <U>be
responsible to their group members for assignments</U>. When
attending class, be on time and remain for the duration of class.
Late arrivals and early departures distract everyone in the class and
will not be tolerated.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Index Cards: Each student
is responsible for bringing to class several 3 by 5 inch index cards.
I will ask you to fill them out with the date, your name, and the
topic of that day&#146;s class. As class discussion progresses
(that&#146;s you talking, not me!), I will collect cards from those
who make an especially good point or demonstrate a mastery of the
reading under discussion. The intent is to make this &#147;class
participation&#148; grade more concrete. When I collect cards in
discussion you will immediately know what a good point is, and will
learn to make better use of the discussion portion of the class.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>IV. Assignments and
Grading</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Grades will consist of
the following assignments;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Exam 1 (in
class)								10%</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 5.5in; text-indent: -5.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Exam 2 (in class)								10%</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Physical Geography
Atlas							20%</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Exam 3 (in
class)								10%</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Exam 4 (Final), see
schedule							10%</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Human Geography
Atlas							20%</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 5.5in; text-indent: -5.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Pop quizzes, homework assignments, class
participation			20%</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 4.5in; text-indent: -4.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Total for the class								100 percent</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Grading for the class is
as follows: 0-59%=F, 60-69 %=D, 70-79%=C, 80-89%=B, 90-100=A. In
borderline cases I reserve the right to determine which grade is
assigned. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	All assignments (that are
not done in class) must be typed, double spaced, stapled, and turned
in at the beginning of the class period in which it is due. Given
today&#146;s word processing technology and the advent of spell
checking functions, submitted assignments should be error free.
Papers submitted with typographical errors or misspelled words will
earn a zero. No late work or hand-written papers will be accepted.
All work submitted must clearly identify the author (presumably you)
by name, student identification number and class section number, as
well as sources of any materials and ideas used (see plagiarism).
Finally, I do not give incompletes.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	This class is structured
to accommodate different learning styles and working styles. Almost
half (40%) of your grade is earned in a group project setting, while
60% is earned on the basis of solo work (quizzes, exams, abstracts,
etc.). This class is structured for three separate exposures to the
same material. First you read about it, then you talk about it, then
you write about it. I pretty much assume that if you haven&#146;t
gotten it by then, you are never going to get it. But engaging the
material in these three different ways, two of which are active
engagement, you should not only learn the material but also be able
to explain it to someone else. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>V. Plagiarism/Academic
Dishonesty</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	 Plagiarism is the act of
using someone else&#146;s words, pictures, ideas, or procedures
without proper acknowledgment, or to present them as if they
originated with you. In science and especially in academics,
plagiarism is unacceptable. In an exam, for example, copying from
someone else&#146;s test booklet and handing it in as if it were your
own work is plagiarism. In some instances it is difficult to document
whether plagiarism has occurred. In other situations, particularly a
learning situation, it is possible that students who do not know the
protocols of academic expression can inadvertently plagiarize. In
some cultures, direct use of another person&#146;s works bring great
honor to the quoted person. In this university, plagiarism
constitutes a form of cheating, and will not be tolerated. If you are
unsure whether to cite someone else&#146;s work as you write an
assignment, come talk to me about it.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	University regulations
regarding academic misconduct, as set forth in the UCA Student
Handbook and other University documents and publications, will be
strictly enforced. Penalties for plagiarism or cheating range from
failing the assignment to being expelled from the University.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	The Arkansas Atlas
project places an additional burden upon the author in this class.
First, all material that is not original (i.e., yours) must be cited.
However the Arkansas Atlas projects are also teaching tools. Their
purpose is to help people learn more about geographic concepts and
Arkansas&#146; geography. As such, they will view your Arkansas Atlas
projects as the starting point and, probably, want to learn more.
Information that you might consider &#147;common knowledge&#148; or
easily obtained from a reference book, such as the constitution of
Arkansas, is not so common to a reader from Belize. Therefore, also
cite material as a means of directing the reader to source documents
and other information. Do not assume that they are familiar with our
region, culture, government or economy. When in doubt, ask about
citations. What is &#147;common knowledge&#148; here, is not
necessarily that around the globe. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>VI. Students with
Disabilities</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	It is the policy of UCA
to accommodate students with disabilities pursuant to federal and
state law. Any student with a disability who needs accommodations,
for example in seating placement or in arrangements for examinations,
should inform me at the beginning of the course. Students with
disabilities are also encouraged to contact the Disabled Student
Services office, located in Bernard Hall, room 205 (450-3135).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>											</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>VII. Helpful Hints</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	A few hints (borrowed
from Dr. Jeff Allender&#146;s geography syllabus) for success in this
class (and life in general). Stay up-to-date on the readings. Now
only will it prepare you for the exams, but you will follow the
lectures and discussion much better than if you are coming in
unprepared. In will allow you to contribute to the class discussions
and to intelligently analyze the ideas and concepts we will discuss
later.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	As most of the exam
questions will come from the class discussion and lectures (being
reinforced by the readings), taking good, efficient notes is
essential. Study in your Atlas groups and go over your notes
regularly to make sure that you are getting the main ideas. In class,
look for the main ideas and concepts. In the book they are
highlighted by subheads. I attempt to verbally identify major breaks
and new concepts in my lecture. Also refer to the outline that I put
on the board for each lecture. If, at the end of class you have taken
more than a page to a page and one half of notes for every 30 minutes
of class, then you are focusing on the examples, not the larger
concepts. On the other hand, if you are taking less than half a page
per 30 minutes of class, you either already know the material and
this is simply review, or you are not catching the major concepts.
Critical listening, and note taking are acquired skills, but they are
essential in life for the purpose of seeing the big picture and
making the connections to everyday life. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Finally, if you are
having trouble in class or are not doing well on the exams, please
see me immediately. I work on campus. I live on campus. If my 18
office hours per week are not convenient, we can make arrangements
for another time. Working on a problem early in the semester is often
successful, whereas waiting until the last week is simply too late.
You will note from the calendar that fully half of the total points
in this class will be awarded by midterm. If you are flunking at that
point, it may be mathematically impossible for you to pull it out at
the end. Put the work in at the front end of the semester. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	If you find that at some
time during the semester, personal problems are keeping you from
completing your course work, you may find it beneficial to visit the
counseling center. All students are entitled to free, confidential,
professional counseling. Their office is located at Bernard Hall,
#313, 450-3138. </FONT>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	In the Department of
Geography, Political Science and Sociology, instructors strive to
create an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect in which learning,
debate, and intellectual growth can thrive. Creating this atmosphere
requires that instructors and students work to achieve a classroom in
which learning is not disrupted. At the most basic level this means
that everyone attend class, be prepared with readings and assignments
completed, and that students pay attention. This means no
conversations with friends, reading the newspaper, coming late, or
leaving early. Such behavior is disruptive to the instructor and to
your fellow classmates.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	These basics of classroom
etiquette are an important means of building and showing mutual
respect. Inevitably, however, disagreements will arise. Sometimes
these disagreements will be about content, sometimes about grades or
course procedures, and sometimes they will be about the treatment of
participants in the class. In order to facilitate the resolution of
these disagreements, the following guidelines should be followed by
everyone:</FONT></P>

between student and instructor. If an instructor feels that your
speech or behavior is abusive, you will be asked to leave the room.
If you believe an instructor has become abusive, you may leave the
room and talk with the department chairperson. Debate and discussion
can continue when all parties proceed with mutual respect.</FONT></P>

submitted in 12 point type, Times New Roman font, with paper margins
of one inch on all sides and double spaced. Two hard (printed) copies
must be submitted as well as one electronic copy (on disk). Remember
to staple your report. All electronic submission must be in PC
Microsoft Word and/or Excel and/or MGE/ArcView. Pay particular
attention to the citations (see &#147;Guide to citing sources for
Geography 1305&quot;). The intent is to take these research projects
and place them on the Geography department&#146;s web page. In other
words, once published, anyone will be able to view these reports. So,
be careful about citing your sources. By the same token, do not make
your report a lengthy string of quotes. No more than 20 words should
be used in a single quote. Paraphrase when necessary, put the
material in your own words as much as possible. Please note that if
you are directly citing a web site in your text that you should
provide the abbreviated link in the text (e.g.,
http:\www.theatlantic.com) and the full citation including title in
your reference section. If you are attaching maps or illustrations,
they should be referenced and discussed in the text. Do not let them
simply hang off the back of the report.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Every word processing
program has a spell check function. Use it. Drafts and finals
submitted with misspelled words will be given a zero (1/5 of your
grade). At the very minimum have at least one other person proof and
edit your work before you submit it. I will mark down for poor
grammar, organization, etc. The preferred style is APA. Also note
that both the draft and the final must be reviewed by the Writing
Center. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The Atlas Assignments:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>	Each student
will review the list of proposed topics. Consider your interests,
your background and experience, maybe even skim the text if you are
unfamiliar with some of the topics (see Web page listings in some
chapters). The point of this assignment is that you choose to spend
more time with a topic that you like, or a topic that you would like
to learn more about. I will consider alternative topics that are not
on the list IF three or more students propose them and IF you talk to
me before bids are due. Each student will bid on <U>one</U> topic
(from physical or GIS) for the first Atlas project, and <U>one</U>
alternative topic. During the second half of the semester you will
bid on a topic from the list of either human geography topics or GIS.
The reason for the alternative topic is that I will not allow an
Atlas group to be smaller than three members, and if your primary
topic has no other bidders, then I will assign you to your
alternative topic. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Bids: </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Once you have selected
your topic (and alternative), each student will make a typed bid for
a topic, and make a case for researching that topic (your interest in
the topic, your special experience/skills/training, why you in
particular would do the best research job for that topic, and a
&#147;rough&#148; idea of where you would go for information and what
you would collect). Warning: Each bid MUST include: your name, your
topic, the number from the list (e.g. &#147;C.2 Mapping the Atlas&#148;)
and the same for your alternative bid. Based on bids I will assign
individuals into teams for each topic. Following assignment to a
team, each team will elect a coordinator and coin a team name (bonus
points for creativity). Group members will also fill out and sign a
&#147;Group Contract&#148; that outlines their responsibilities to
the group.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>	There are
three separate stages of Atlas project development. The first is a
rough or draft proposed research agenda. This includes; 1. the
research question(s), 2. proposed sources of information, proposed
resources to be used, and 3. plan of action (who is responsible for
what, when, etc.). The purpose of the outline is to help you focus
your research question, tackle a reasonable topic, and provide ideas
for resources. It is also designed to head off future problems. These
drafts will be commented upon and returned in class. At that time a 
format for the final submission will be distributed in class. The
second stage of the Atlas project development is the draft paper. The
draft must be reviewed by the University Writing Center (Irby 118)
prior to submission in class. Reservations are not required, but
highly recommended. This should be done a few days in advance since
the reviewer may make comments and suggestions for improvements that
you want to incorporate. Please note: No draft Atlas projects will be
accepted without a Writing Center review slip attached to the
document. Drafts are just that, the work completed to date. I do not
expect a completed paper. By the same token, you should have <U>most</U>
of your research done and some of your text and references. There
will be detailed comments, criticisms, and suggestions on your
drafts. The third and final stage of the Atlas project is the final
submission. As to participation, note that, as part of the
submission, each member of the team will grade the contribution of
other members of the team. These grading sheets are confidential and
yes, if a group member has contributed zero to the project you may
grade them as a zero (for 20% of their grade, the weight of the Atlas
project). </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	In approaching these
research projects keep in the mind the purposes of this activity. The
first purpose, is to allow you to delve into a research topic that
interests you. The discipline of geography is broad enough to
encompass a number of interesting issues and problems. So, select a
topic that you would like to learn more about.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	The second purpose is to
produce research that is interesting, informative and publishable,
with the end result of collecting these research assignments into a 
publishable atlas. You must approach your assignment from the
perspective that you are writing a chapter in an geographic atlas
about Conway and Arkansas. In very general terms you must poise a
geographically related question and then answer it, and in the
process tell an interesting story. In other words, tell an
informative story that any layperson could understand and follow.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>	You must
demonstrate some creativity in your research sources. No more than
half the material used may be from Internet sites. Other sources
include (but are not limited to): government publications, annuals,
atlases, books, journals, magazines, guides, newspapers (Nexis is an
acceptable source), UCA library archives and interviews. Sources that
are <U>prohibited</U> in the Atlas are encyclopedias and
dictionaries. You may use them as background information, but you may
not cite them as a source in your Atlas. This is college and we have
moved beyond encyclopedias.  I encourage students to interview people
working in their respective fields to gather the latest information
relating to their topic (e.g., faculty, instructors, local and state
officials, etc). </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Warning: All material
that is not original must be properly cited (see the statement in the
syllabus about plagiarism). Citing material serves two purposes.
First, it identifies primary (original) versus secondary information.
Work that is not cited is assumed to be your own original work.
Second, it enables readers to locate the original source of
information.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Format</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	The final assignments
will be submitted in both digital and hard copy form. All digital
submissions must be in Microsoft Word and/or Excel and/or ArcView (a
GIS format). The format is 12 point, Times New Roman font, paper
margins of one inch on all sides, and double spaced. Additional
details about the assignment will be announced in class.</FONT></P>
