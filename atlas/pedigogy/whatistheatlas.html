<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Arkansas Atlas is a Web-based collection of UCA student research
projects related specifically to Arkansas physical and cultural
geography. However it is much more than a collection of information.
It is a high technology device being used to enhance our student&#146;s
engagement with learning, increase their level of effort, and
publicize UCA&#146;s student accomplishments on the World Wide Web,
according to Arkansas Atlas creator Ron Cossman, a lecturer in the
Geography department and Resident Master of Hughes Residential
College.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
rough draft or &#147;beta&#148; version is on a student&#146;s web
site while final touches are made before it is place on the
Geography, Political Science and Sociology web site. It may currently
be viewed at: http://www.3sharks.com/atlas.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Atlas serves several purposes. First, it enables students to put
additional effort and pride into their class work. &#147;Simply
knowing that their projects will be read by others, perhaps even
their grandmother, students take more responsibility for their
projects,&#148; Cossman said. Anecdotal evidence from the students
themselves confirms that they approach this learning project much
more seriously, given the higher visibility and stakes involved. The
experiences from the Arkansas Atlas project will be used as the basis
for an application to the National Science Foundation for a special
grant to further explore the impact of technology in the classroom on
educational outcomes.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
second purpose of the electronic Atlas is to serve as a springboard
for similar student research in other disciplines. &#147;There is no
reason that students in an Arkansas history class could not take some
of the information in the Atlas, expand upon it, and publish
additional research. Our Geographic Information Systems (GIS) class
could develop electronic maps to supplement some of the projects. The
combinations are endless,&#148; Cossman said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
third purpose of the Atlas is to support writing across the
curriculum. Initially students do not expect that they will be
writing in a geography course. When they discover the breadth of
geographic topics, they easily develop an affinity for a topic on
which they can write about.  Current educational research documents
the fact that students who are interested in their course material
will engage it at a higher level. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
fourth purpose of the Atlas is to establish a unique body of
information about Arkansas and the region. &#147;The variety of
topics that the students have developed as research papers is
amazing. Topics range from the risk of earthquakes and the history of
volcanoes in Arkansas to the spatial diffusion of music in Arkansas
and where social control districts are located on UCA&#146;s campus,&#148;
Cossman said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
final purpose of the Atlas is to be a very visible, high technology
recruitment tool. &#147;Marketed properly, the Atlas could be the
crown jewel of UCA&#146;s freshman recruitment program. We can point
to it and say, &#145;Look what our freshman are involved in, and
capable of doing, on the Web. Don&#146;t you want to be a part of
that freshman class?&#146;&#148; said Cossman. Marketing on the Web
is also virtually cost free, making it an attractive tool to market
UCA to computer savvy would-be students.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">	Cossman
plans three more major improvements to the Atlas before the end of
the semester. First, a section entitle Pedagogy will be added. This
will include a description of how the Atlas was incorporated into a
freshman Principles of Geography class, a copy of the class syllabus
and on-line copies of forms used in class including student
permission to publish their research forms. The second addition will
be two disclaimers. The first is a warning that the work is student
research and not peer reviewed or tested. A second warning will also
be posted on how to properly cite the material contained on the web
site. &#147;Plagiarism was a major issue among my students, but not
in the way that you would think. The &#145;C&#146; students were
concerned that they properly cite all their material and not be
guilty of plagiarism. It was my &#145;A&#146; students who were
concerned that other people would plagiarize <U>them</U>!&#148;
Cossman said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
third addition will be the completion of up-loading all the maps,
audio clips and video clips that are part of some of the Atlas
projects. &#147;I continually emphasized to my students that this was
not to be a static paper report. Exploit the full capabilities of the
Web by including audio, video, animation, anything the web can
handle. Make your report come alive.&#148; Cossman said. </FONT></FONT>
