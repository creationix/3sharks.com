did religion come into in Arkansas?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
wasn’t just here when different people came and settled the land.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Different religions were introduced into
Arkansas through spatial diffusion; this is the process by which a concept,
practice, innovation, or substance spread from its point of origin to new
territory (Getis, Getis, &amp;Fellmann 1998: 243).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Indians living in Arkansas when the first white men came were members of the
Dakota family; this great family of Indians was made up of 12 tribes which came
from the East into what is now Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, and
Nebraska.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The three main tribes in
Arkansas were the Quapaws, Caddo, and Osages, but there is not much information
on the religion of any of these groups except the Quapaws (McKnight&amp;Johnson
1955: 27).<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Like
many Indian tribes, the Quapaws believed in a supernatural spirit that
permeated everything around them, from rocks, wind, and vegetation to animals
and people, and occupied the superior position in their view of life (Davis
1991: 96).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This type of belief that
life, or spirits exist in all things is called Animism (Getis, Getis,
&amp;Fellmann 1998: 260).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
supernatural spirit<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>was identified with
the sun and called Wah Kon Dah, an name derived for the root, Wa Kan, meaning
sacred, mysterious, sacred thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In
colonial travelers’ accounts, this supernatural force was referred to as the
Great Manitou, or Great Spirit (Davis 1991: 96).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Along
with the great forces found in all things, every Quapaw family had a guardian
spirit, or manitou, and religious rites were conducted by a group known as
Wapinan, the Holy Men, and shamans (Davis 1991: 97).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Therefor, the Quapaw religion, along with many other Indian
tribes, was known as Shamanism; it is the religion in which a shaman, through
special power, can interpret the spirit world (Getis, Getis, &amp; Fellman
1998: 260).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>French writers used the
word jongleur, meaning juggler or trickster, for the shaman who in English is
called a medicine man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One writer,
Bossu, stated that the jongleurs “performed duties of priests, physicians, and
surgeons and want to be regarded as soothsayers.”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They employed sleight-of-hand to mystify and impress spectators
when they treated patients with herbal concoctions, drenching, and sweat baths
(Davis 1991: 97).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
the white men came into Arkansas they brought with them Christianity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Christianity has its basis in the life and
teachings of Jesus, a Jewish preacher in the 1<sup>st</sup> century of the
modern era, who was believed to be the messiah promised by God.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its main belief is salvation for all
humankind (Getis, Getis,&amp; Fellmann 1998: 262).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The white men wanted to convert the Indians to Catholicism, a
type of Christianity, but the task was difficult, if not impossible.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first expedition into Arkansas was led
by Hernando de Soto.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The king of Spain
had appointed him as governor of Cuba and Florida; so, after his expedition
into Cuba, De Soto landed in Florida in 1539.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>For his first two years, De Soto traveled through Florida, Alabama,
Georgia, and Missouri.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He crossed into
Arkansas in 1541, where he found the Indian tribes usually friendly and willing
to share their food with him, but the Spaniards were often cruel to the
natives, causing setbacks in relations with the natives.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>De Soto was eager to find gold in Arkansas,
and Christianity was an advantage in getting cooperation from the Indians,
possibly in getting information on the location of gold.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>De Soto had his men erect a cross, told the
Indians the story about Jesus, and asked them to worship him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some natives believed that De Soto himself
was Jesus, or some kind of god.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During
the dry summer, De Soto was asked to make it rain; a religious service was held
and prayer was offered, and soon it rained, with the Indians believing more than
ever that De Soto was a god.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, De
Soto never found gold, and Spanish Catholicism did not spread (McKnight &amp;
Johnson 1955: 37-38).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was 131 years before any white men came into Arkansas again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1663, the governor of Quebec sent Father
Marquette, a missionary of the French Catholic Church, and Louis Joliet, a rich
merchant, to determine if there was a water route to the Pacific in the New
World.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The explorers were unable to get
any information about the Mississippi River or the body of water that it
emptied into (McKnight &amp; Johnson 1955: 40-41).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Fortunately, they were able to get some hospitality and
information from the Akamsea, a Quapaw tribe, after Father<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Marquette showed them the calumet, or peace
pipe, that he had received from the Illinois Indians upstream.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The pipe was sacred to the Indians
throughout the Mississippi Valley because they looked upon it as the calumet of
the sun and offered it to the latter to smoke when they wanted a calm, rain, or
fair weather.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because Father Marquette
had the calumet, the Akamsea held him in high regards and indicated to him that
they wanted him to return and teach them his faith (Davis 1991: 95-96).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Then
in 1682, La Salle and Henri de Tonti arrived in Arkansas and visited the same
people that Marquette and Joliet had visited ten years earlier.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They planted a cross, symbolizing the French
Catholic Church, and claimed all of the land for France.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When La Salle died on a later expedition De
Tonti went searching for him, and established the first white settlement, the
Arkansas Post, in 1686. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>De Tonti
granted the Catholic Church a large tract of land and paid a priest to serve
the Post and his Indian friends nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Father Allouey, the great missionary to the Huron Indians, probably was
the first priest to come to Arkansas Post under this arrangement; regular
visits were held among the Indians also (McKnight &amp; Johnson 1955: 44).<span

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Arkansas
Post was a profitable center of trade, and along with the traders and trappers
came the priests, eager to preach to the Indians, undergoing suffering and death
in the process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Father Fouccault was
received by the Quapaws in 1700, they expected him to establish a permanent
mission, but he was killed by two Koroa Indian guides in 1702, supposedly for
trying to leave Arkansas (Morris 1991: 88).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Then, Father Paul du Poisson planned to become a permanent resident of
Arkansas Post.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He learned the Quapaw
language and asked that pictures be sent from France because the Indians loved
the pictures of St. Regis (Hall 1941: 89).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Unfortunately, he was murdered in an Indian massacre at Natchez in 1729;
the Natchez burst into the chapel he was praying at and cut his head off with a
hatchet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Father Carette, who took up
the post<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in 1750, left in 1758 due to
not having a chapel and the &quot;bad conduct and freedom of language&quot; of
his parishioners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The French never sent
a replacement (Morris 1991: 89).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
French were forced to give all of their Louisiana Territory to Spain in 1762 to
keep the English from getting it after the French and Indian War; Spain had a
great commitment of furthering Christianity, Catholicism, in the New
World.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, conversion was focused
on the white settlers migrating into Arkansas instead of the Indians.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The number of priest were very small until
settlements became big enough to support parishes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>After O'Reilly took command, he wrote a memorandum outlining the
religious needs of the territory and where he planned to send priests, but he
did not even mention Arkansas; it was too remote and too small (Morris 1991:
90).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Arkansas Post Catholics were
included in those that the priest of St. Genevieve, Missouri, served after the
parish there opened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, the 250
mile distance between the settlements and hardships of the travel limited the
visits of the priest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, a Parish
of Arcanzas was established in 1796, and its pastor, Pere Pierre Janin, erected
a chapel in honor of St. Stephen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Three
years later the pastor left for St. Louis, and the parish was once again
dependent upon irregular visits from priests (Davis 1991: 99-101).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

French control, the only immigration into Arkansas was French from Canada or
from lower Louisiana who were devoted to the Catholic Church; however, when the
Spanish took control, immigration and diversity increased.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Several Protestant Anglo-American families
were allowed to move to Arkansas Posts in 1778.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Protestants were required to convert to Catholicism when they
settled in Spanish Territory, but in a few years King Carlos III allowed
Protestants to practice their doctrine in private, although their infants would
have to be baptized in Catholic faith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Also, when performing a marriage between a Catholic and Protestant, the
priest was not allowed to wear vestements (Davis 1991:101-102).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1811, John P. Carnahan, a Cumberland
Presbyterian lay preacher, preached the first Protestant sermon at Arkansas
Post.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His sermon must have been
frustrating since he only spoke English, while most at the post still spoke
French.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Eight years later, Timothy
Flint, a Congregational missionary and author, conducted Sunday services at the
post in French, but he stated that while the people were attentive and polite,
the services were not actually taken seriously (Hall 1941: 83-84).<span

Christian denominations soon spread throughout Arkansas as the number of
settlements and migrants increased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For
example, William Stevenson, a Methodist preacher, established a few Methodist
societies along the Red River in 1814.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He became a circuit rider and others soon followed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The circuit rider created congregations on
settlements and recruited local farmers as unpaid preachers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Methodists asked only that a member have
a personal conversion experience and moral life, in which every man could save
himself through good works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition
to the Methodists, the Missouri Bethel Baptist Association sent Reverend James
Phillip Edwards to organize a Baptist Church, near Little Rock, in 1817.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They believed that preachers should be
unpaid farmers or businessman who had been called by God to preach.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Members watched over each other, and charges
of public offenses meant expulsion from the church (Tucker 1985: 14-15).<span

country after giving up their land to the United States in 1824, the Quapaws
sacrificed an orphan, carried figures of their manitous, performed ritualistic
dances, and shamans treated the sick (Davis 1991: 104).<span

convert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Protestants were able to
convert some of the Cherokees of the area because they were more willing to
adapt to Anglo-American ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Overall
