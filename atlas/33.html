everyday life.&nbsp; It can effect how communities and individual families communicate
with one another and utterly effect how the United State, and the communities
within it, grow.&nbsp; In the past, one of most influential genres has been the
spiritual folk hymn.&nbsp; But, due to the fact that many Americans could not
read music, rapid advancements of new and different types of spiritual folk
hymns across America were not possible.&nbsp; So, a method of reading music was
introduced to a vast majority of the Americans, called shape note singing.
Although, the precursors of shape note singing began many centuries ago, it was
not until shape note singing was incorporated into the rich history and culture
of American spirituals did its diffusion in the United States really become
important.</span></tt><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>But today’s recognized system of
shape-notes is quite different from its precursors.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The first system ever devised using syllables to denote pitches
was in the eleventh century, by the monk Guido of Arezzo.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He constructed a hexachord system of six
syllables consisting of ut, re, mi, fa, sol, and la.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>For many centuries this was the norm.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Guido trained young men to sing by using this hexachord system.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But, it was not until the sixteenth century
that singers from all across England began to use a shorter version, which
consisted of just using the four syllables fa, sol, la, and mi.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the same time, many different countries
across Europe expanded on Guido’s hexachord system, which became a
seven-syllable system (Italian:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>do re
me fa sol la si).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Soon many British and
European societies became accustomed to the use of these four and seven
syllable systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But due to
centrifugal forces, many colonists began to move to North America for religious
refuge, as a result relocation diffusion began to occur.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Soon after the colonies rooted and began to
grow, an irredentist society formed with in many of these colonies.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>As a result, political and social reforms
were not easily welcomed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>(Law, 1997:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>http://) But, in the mid-seventeenth century, Massachusetts, Virginia,
and Pennsylvania became the three most successful colonies within North America
for these areas became cultural hearths.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>These areas contained a vast number of people in which ways of life,
distinctive technologies, and cultural traits could develop.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Within these societies, strong religious
communities became a way of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In
the religious communities, congregational singing was a cultural trait that had
developed among the Protestant churches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Through congregational singing many people could come together and sing
for the sole purpose of praising God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(
Getis,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>55-64)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>So, as congregational singing
became more prevalent in the churches, the spiritual folk hymn was born.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This genre of music began within the
Caucasian community and was based on many verses from Psalms.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But, during this time many people could not
read music, and the only way in which a congregation could learn music was
through oral repetition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>As a result,
one of the technological advancements that occurred was in the development of
singing schools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>                </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>These singing schools helped teach many individuals
how to sing, but unfortunately, it was at a very slow rate. For it took time to
teach people how to recognize different types of notes, key signatures, and
relating that to actually notes on a staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But, in 1790 a man from Philadelphia named John Connolly developed four
distinct geometrical note shapes to represent different syllables, of the
four-note syllable system (which was later to be called shaped notes).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He decided to use a triangle for the
syllable “Fa”, an oval for the syllable “Sol”, a square for the syllable “La”,
and a diamond for the syllable “Mi”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'>With this new system, there
was no need to worry about different key signatures and the shapes ingeniously
indicated where the different pitches were, therefore the intervals were always
the same between different shapes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a
result, Connolly began to teach his family and different parts of his community
a new way to read music without ever learning how to read Western musical
notation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This allowed people to ignore
all previous musical teaching methods and learn how to read music at faster
rate of speed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(Law, 1997:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>http://)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>But, thanks
to the “Better School Movement” and individuals such as Lowell Mason, shape
notes were given barriers to diffusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In this “Better School Movement” Mason allow and encouraged many
European styled musicians to systematically remove shape notes from being
taught across the colonies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Fortunately
in 1801, Connolly sold the shape note system to William Little and William
Smith, who produced the first shape-note songbooks, called the Easy Instructor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the Easy Instructor, the rich historical
and oral traditions that had been passed down from generation to generation had
been published.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was the first
example of mass productions of spiritual folk hymns across America.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Unfortunately soon after, civil war broke
out between the north and the south and a new barrier emerged.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result the friction of distance became
so great the singing school movement ceased to exist and the new focus for
attention was on the division between these two regions.<span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Luckily around the mid 1800’s, a non-denominational
singing organization developed called the Sacred Harp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This organization developed within the small
farming communities of the west and south.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The formation of this group had occurred due to the fact the modernization,
a massive diffusing barrier, had not reached the smaller farming communities of
the west and south.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This group usually
came together prior to or directly after a harvest.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The Sacred Harp focused on the musical event and emphasized
community participation, not performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Since the Sacred Harp focused on community development, time honored
traditions began to form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At each
yearly harvest, distant communities would come together and form huge camp
meeting and sing songs in the memory of others. At these camp meetings, the
singers referred to, as &quot;the class” would not sit in a formal sectional
choral, but in a hollow square facing one another, each part on equal sides of
the square. The &quot;arranging committee&quot; or coordinators allow different
singers to lead various songs to “the class”. The singers are arranged around
the leader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The melody, which is the
tenor section, faces the leader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
altos are directly opposite of the tenor section while the basses are to the
right and the sopranos (trebles) are to the left.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The use of instruments is totally unacceptable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore, someone with a good sense of
relative pitch gives the pitch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
pitch is usually given 1 to 2 whole steps lower than the written pitch to
enables people to sing in a comfort zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The leader sings the tenor (lead) part if possible and determines the
tempo by beating of the hand up and down with 2 or 3 beats per measure, but
with slow 4/4 songs occasionally in a cross pattern with 4 beats per
measure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The singers sing with volume,
intensity, and enthusiasm, which transcends down to each and every person in
the room. The soprano and tenor parts are identical and are sung in unison but
usually an octave apart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The focus is
on community rather than choral singing, so the use of dynamics is of less
concern and the blending of voices is not observed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The beauty and moving moments in Sacred Harp music is
demonstrated through the feeling of total community involvement. (Willard,
1998:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>http://)</p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Each song is sung first by singing the
syllables of the four shape notes (<i>fa, sol, la, mi</i>), followed by singing
of the words. This practice conforms to and honors the singing school tradition
and assists in learning the tune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But
the main purpose of the formation of the Sacred Harp was to create powerful
music together in a friendly, accepting atmosphere, while singing the
spiritually meaningful words in remembrance of the deceased, sick, and shut-in
singers from across the community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>(Sabol, 1998:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span><a
href="http:///">http://</a><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With the development of the Sacred Harp,
many communities grew a close nit society in which communication barriers
ceased to exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But, soon the twentieth century came and
modernization utterly destroyed the close nit societies.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The nuclear family was disappearing due to
the urbanization of the surrounding countryside.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Also, the harvesting season was no longer a focal point for
community development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result, the
initial appeal for community development changed from remembering the deceased
or sick and shut in singers of the community to the quick hustle and bustle of
city life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As modernization began to slowly diffuse
across the country, social change slowly broke down the racial barriers that
had kept many individuals from communicating socially and religiously.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result, many of the white and black
communities began to intermingle and exchange ideas about religion and
community development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>As time
progressed, the different societies began to relish the community aspects that
were developed through shape note singing, as a result communication remained
apparent between the black and white communities.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">   </span>As time progressed, communication between the white and black
communities strengthened and the time honored tradition of the Sacred Harp
extended its realm to include many black historical folk spirituals. As many
new publications of Sacred Harp emerged such as Colored Sacred Harp of 1934,
the spiritual folk hymns began to express and exemplify themes of going home to
the promise land, the defeat of satin, and gaining ground against sin, which
demonstrated an existence of a historical oral tradition. (Dyen, 95-132)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>Initially one might wonder where the fascination of
singing shape-notes might come from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Gaylon L. Powell said it was “one of four aspects: the unique sound, the
music is for everyone to sing and not for performance, the meaningful poetry,
and the strong community atmosphere. (Powell, 1996:<span style="mso-spacerun:

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many people are flabbergasted when faced
with this new type of music, for many times it does not resemble one’s
religious affiliations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many find the
sound to be a joyful noise but at the same time it is sung in reverence of
those who have passed away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its unique
harmony, known as dispersed harmony, may demonstrate a new since of
unfamiliarity, but can leave one feeling calm and reassured. “The energy that
the singers use to sing can also be appealing; with this much energy, it shows
that the singers love and enjoy the music they are singing.</span> <span

<p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
new singer will also find comfort in the performance, for it allows everyone to
participate even for the untrained singer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If you can’t carry a tune no one will care for everyone is encouraged to
sing. “The whole setting is very much like that found in Ephesians 5:19,
‘Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and
making melody in your heart to the Lord.’ This text did not even mention the
quality of the voice. (</span>Powell, 1996:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Many
individuals are attracted to the text, for most of the songs resemble sermon
and contain a meaning lesson.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Attending
an all-day singing can be an overwhelming experience for many individuals who
are non-religiously affiliated, for they can come to appreciate the singers
spiritual ideals and move over their personal dedication.<span

Wisconsin, said that being welcomed to join in on the singing had a distinct
feeling of ‘coming home.’ Alix Baillie, of Takoma Park, Maryland, had this
observation, &quot;The way we sing to each other, feed each other, welcome each
other into our homes, accept all comers unconditionally--that's real
Christianity, and 'real' most other religions as well. It is extraordinary and
inexpressibly beautiful. Along with the sense of community with singers across
the square is the sense of community with singers who have gone before--those
recently lost, and those long-dead.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
