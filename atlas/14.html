<P>How did the development of Irish folk music contribute to various cultures around the world as well as American culture?</P>

<P>&#9;&quot;A few generations ago, the Harper, the union piper, the fiddler, and even the dancing-master, were cherished institutions.  They met with cheerful welcome at the homes of the gentry and well-to-do peasantry throughout Ireland and enjoyed the hospitality of their hosts as long as they cared to stay&quot;(O’Neill 9).  Many of the Irish writers present us with happy sketches of the &quot;characteristic features of Irish life in days gone by.&quot;  However, now there is very little in enjoyable entertainment for the present generation.  &quot;Enjoyable entertainment&quot; didn’t become entirely extinct until the early nineteenth century.</P>
<P>&#9;The pipers and fiddlers kept folk music alive and in &quot;vigorous&quot; circulation.  When one of them would make their usual visit to a community, all the people would gather at the &quot;Big House&quot;, or City Hall, in the evenings and listen to the inspiring music that made a home in their hearts.  &quot;Music, of all the arts, is the most universal in its appeal.  From the heart it has come and to the heart it shall penetrate, and all true music shall take these words for its maxim&quot; (O’Neill 14).</P>
<P>&#9;When the term &quot;songs of the people&quot; is used, it refers to the most popular style of music at the present time, and this term is too wide for our purpose nowadays.  &quot;In fact, this term might be a better description of pop music than of folk music&quot; (Breathnach 1).  Folk music is passed on from one generation to another, otherwise known as ‘traditional.’  &quot;Irish folk music includes not only the older songs and melodies of Gael, but also the Anglo-Irish and English ballads of the countryside&quot; (Breathnach 2), and the dances which are a part of the folk music tradition.  There are over 6,000 individual pieces of folk music.</P>
<P>&#9;The jig, which is the oldest form of folk music today, came to Ireland through the Italian Harper’s, even though the Irish claim that it didn’t.  The Irish musicians say that the only similarity that the Irish and Italian jigs have in common is the number of bars in their dance music.  &quot;Music similar to Ireland’s jigs were in circulation in England long before Italian music became popular in the Irish islands&quot; (Breathnach 60).  The Irish say this and that the melodies in Irish jigs are native in origin, and very few are borrowed from Europe and Scotland.  The pipers and fiddlers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries composed a majority of  the jigs and other music that is now popular.</P>
<P>&#9;The harp, the pipes, the fiddle, and the free-reeds are the instruments used in folk music, Irish and American.  The free-reed instruments, the melodeon, concertina, accordion, and the mouth organ, were the latest instruments to join in the composing of folk music.  They all appeared in one shape or another in the first half of the last century.  &quot;They are sounded by a reed which consists of a strip or tongue of metal, and which is fastened over an aperture in a metal frame, through which it vibrates when air pressure is applied to it.  The reeds are grouped in pairs, and air is admitted to each pair by depressing the appropriate key or button on the keyboard (Breathnach 88).</P>
<P>&#9;Harmonic accompaniment, the sweet sounds of harmonies accompanying almost any style of music, is not used in any form in Irish folk music.  Instead, the Irish like to use melodies, which is where everything blends together smoothly and they get a round sound-nothing uneven or unbalanced.  Embellishment, the use of one or more notes that highlight certain notes; variation, the way the notes are arranged;  and rhythm, the beat of a song, are the three main forms of melodies, and examples of each can be found in a single performance (Breathnach 98-99).</P>
<P>&#9;Folk music diffused to America through relocation of the Irish and the Scottish.  Music collectors also traveled to Ireland, as well as Europe and Scotland, in search of new and different styles of music.  The Irish folk music was liked so much by the collectors, that they wrote down the music and brought it back to America where folk bands were developed by the Scots, Irish, and English already living in America.  They performed on streets and in bars.  If a piece of music was accepted by the players and they agreed to claim it and play it without changes, then the community would then learn to accept and like it.  &quot;Various airs were mentioned only to be rejected, since although national and popular they were not the product of a musical tradition that evolved through the process of oral transmission&quot; (Breathnach 125).  </P>
<P>&#9;Japan, China, Indonesia, India, and the Middle East all cultivated musical tradition where the usefulness of the concept, folk music, varies from culture to culture (Encyclopedia Britannica, http://www.eb.com:180).  When a folk song changes as it is passed from one individual to another and performed that way, it is called communal recreation.  This is mostly done by a village, nation, or a family, but it has to be accepted by that community for the &quot;communal recreation&quot; to take place.  It then becomes the property of the whole community.  The community can then &quot;share&quot; their music with another, and what takes place next is called cultural diffusion.  Folk music diffused throughout Europe and America evenly from the Middle Ages until the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century.  &quot;Folk music of European origin became mixed with elements of non-Western music&quot; (Encyclopedia Britannica, <A HREF="http://www.eb.com:180)/"><FONT SIZE=2>http://www.eb.com:180)</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>&#9;Scholars have divided folk music into national and regional styles, and this is justified by the traditional and settled nature of folk art.  There are many styles including Jewish, Christian, Islamic, mountain, valley, seaboard, classical, romantic, realistic, fantastic, expressionistic, naturalistic, abstract, and period styles (Encyclopedia Britannica, <A HREF="http://www.eb.com:180)/"><FONT SIZE=2>http://www.eb.com:180)</FONT></A>.  Ethnic, occupational, and religious minorities are in the modern industrial nations where folk music is &quot;perpetuated&quot; , and they are thought to be the ones to promote self-esteem, self-preservation, and social solidarity.  The U.S. Civil Rights and trade unionism movements have been some of the organizations advocation social change, that folk music has had a part in.  There have been, and still are, many great folklorists.  One though, will always be remembered.</P>
<P>&#9;Born June 20, 1907 in Mountain View, Arkansas, James Corbett Morris (a.k.a. Jimmy Driftwood), wrote more than 6,000 folk songs and won many Grammy awards.  His grandfather made him a &quot;guitar&quot; from a fence rail, an ox yoke, and the headboard of a bed, which he learned to play on.  After performing at numerous regional folk festivals, having numerous smash hits and albums, and being offered to perform at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, he wanted to pursue his lifelong passion: preserving folk music and its culture.  The Ozark Folk Center in Mountain View was created by Driftwood when he obtained $3.4 million in the state’s funding.  He also founded the annual Ozark Folk Festival.  He performed free of charge in the Driftwood Barn, and later asked that the space be used to study folk music.  He later the barn to his alma mater, which is now the University of Central Arkansas.  Jimmy Driftwood always remained close to his roots, and helped preserve all of folk music and its culture, as it should be.  (Year in Review 1998: Obituary, 1).</P>
