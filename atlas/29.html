<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">What Impact Does Human Intervention
Have on the Whitetail Deer Population of North Central</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Arkansas?</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">&#160;</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Human impact on
the population of a given species generally takes either of two
forms:&#160; ways in which a species. population is reduced or
enhanced, or ways in which a population.s habitat is encroached upon
or enhanced.&#160; In examining the impact of man.s actions upon
whitetail deer in north central Arkansas, it becomes necessary to
consider the species from: 1. a biological perspective, 2.&#160; a
historical perspective, and 3.&#160; a management perspective.&#160;
The term .wildlife management. is now&#160; preferred to the older
.game management,. (Stout, 1999, p.1) and even this terminology
reflects a change in perspective.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Human intervention
on the whitetail deer population takes various forms, including
sharing a habitat, cutting or otherwise changing a forest dwelling,
food plots and brush piles created with the purpose of increasing
deer numbers, etc.&#160; It is impossible to consider this topic
without also considering the issue of hunting. Of the many
environmental impacts mankind has on our earth, few are more likely
to arouse controversy in contemporary dialogue.&#160; We now turn our
attention to the consideration of whitetail deer from a biological
perspective.</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 0.33in"><B>Whitetail Deer: A Biological
Perspective</B></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Whitetail deer are
at home in a variety of habitats.&#160; Originally woodland animals,
they now prosper in such diverse locations as the broken cover of the
Midwestern plains, the foothills of the Rockies, and farm and ranch
lands.&#160; They live in the arid parts of southwestern Texas and
northern Mexico where drought prevails and temperatures can exceed
100 degrees F.&#160; In such locations, they survive eating such food
as guajillo, blackbrush, and prickly pear.&#160; They also live in
the northern U.S. and Canada in sub-zero temperatures.&#160; In these
locations, they eat cedar, ground hemlock and maple (Biggs, 1994, p.
42).&#160; The topography of north-central Arkansas provides a rugged
terrain with secluded ridges and deep draws, broken by farmland,
pastures and creek bottoms that provide a suitable habitat for deer
(Bowman, Nov.12, 1996, Section C).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">The most serious
threat to whitetails everywhere is expanding human populations and
thus the inevitable destruction of natural habitats.&#160; This
forces deer to move to less productive habitats.&#160; Such
encroachment has limited or doomed many other animal species, but the
whitetail deer has been able to move, adjust, and prosper more
successfully than any large wild animal (Biggs, 1994, p.43) except
the coyote (Davis, 1998).&#160; In fact, as humans have spread, they
have actually created habitat for deer.&#160; According to Jay
Kirkpatrick, director of science and conservation biology at Zoo
Montana in Billings, .Urbanization provides a deer with everything it
could ever want . . . ornamental shrubs, gardens and lawns to eat,
half acres of woods here and there to bed down in . . . the only
predators are cars.. (Nelson, 1994, p.36). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">The whitetail deer
is said to be one of the most adaptable animals on earth.&#160; One
of its adaptations is a relatively high reproductive rate for an
animal of its size (Young, 1995,<U> </U>p.3).&#160; Does can breed as
early as six months in some areas (Nelson, p.36), although typically,
they don.t reach sexual maturity until one year of age and begin
having young at age two (Donaldson, 1951, p.10).&#160; They then bear
young every year, often giving birth to twins and even triplets.&#160;
Over the course of an average 10-year lifespan, one doe and her
offspring could produce 100 fawns (Nelson, p.37).&#160; Even when
compared to other deer, the whitetail.s reproductive rate is high
(Young, p.3).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">&#160;Deer on poor
diets have a lower pregnancy rate and delayed sexual maturity.&#160;
However, the birth rate of even poorly-nourished white-tail deer is
high enough that births will more than replace the parents.&#160; In
one study of birth rates in poorly nourished does, a herd.s
population increased by nearly 80%.&#160; The reproduction rate can
range from 1.15 fawns per poorly nourished doe to 1.85 fawns per
well-nourished doe&#160; (Young, p.3).&#160; Clearly, even when
subjected to inadequate nourishment, a deer population will continue
to expand.&#160; However, the condition of individuals in the herd
will suffer.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">The whitetail deer
of the Arkansas Ozarks are more dependent on acorns for survival than
are whitetail in other parts of the country.&#160; The soil of this
mountainous area produces lower nutritional quality browse (Treat,
1991, p.2).&#160; When there is insufficient food, a natural
.controlling influence,. in the form of fawn sex ratio, neonatal
mortality (death of newborns), and winter mortality will occur
(Young, p. 4).&#160; In years of poor acorn yields, studies have
shown that the whitetail deer of Arkansas have higher mortality rates
due to otherwise non-fatal conditions, such as parasites and being
chased by dogs (Treat, p.5).&#160; The acorn yield is affected by
many variables, ranging from drought to harvesting of oak timber to
the age of trees and the tree.s exposure to sunlight (Treat, p. 9).&#160;
However, as Treat points out in her thesis dealing with whitetail
deer and their habitat in Arkansas, .too much clearing is harmful
because it severely restricts the number of acorn producing trees;
too little clearing is harmful because insufficient sunlight inhibits
acorn production and new plant growth on the forest floor..&#160;
(Treat, p.10). Since these variables are not always within man.s
control, whether or not deer get insufficient food is not totally the
result of manmade influences.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">In expanding
populations, death from malnutrition is more likely, and it is a
slow, painful process.&#160; Young.s article quotes John Ozoga in
<U>Whitetail Winter:</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.94in; margin-right: 0.94in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.33in">
&#160;.Fat depletion and physical weakening progress with nearly
undetectable signs, until it.s too late for recovery.&#160; In the
final stages . . . a deer.s coat roughens, its hip bones show, and
hollows appear in its flanks.&#160; The starving animal spends most
of its time bedded down in a curled head to tail position to minimize
body surface exposure.&#160; It adopts a lethargic, uncaring
attitude, no longer bounding away, flag waving, (authors. note - flag
refers to the deer.s tail) as danger nears.&#160; Small deer,
especially, stand humpbacked, their front legs spread slightly, back
legs close together, holding their heads up at a 45-degree angle
(below horizontal) . .&#160; Thereafter, a deer so stressed could no
longer handle the metabolic stress of feeding.. (Young, pp. 4-5). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Biologically, one
would expect a deer.s high reproductive rates to be balanced by high
mortality rates from some of the previously mentioned factors,
resulting in reduced populations.&#160; However, looking at the broad
historical perspective of whitetail deer populations in Arkansas,
this does not prove to be the case.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in"><B>Whitetail Deer:
A Historical Perspective</B></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Arkansas had large
numbers of whitetail deer in its early history. Indians made use of
most of the deer, from its meat to its bones and skin. Later,
settlers used the deer for clothing and food.&#160; While there are
no exact numbers of the deer population when white settlers first
came, it is generally agreed that it wasn.t until the turn of the
century that Arkansas. deer herd suffered a major decline.&#160; As
man encroached into the deer.s habitat, building roads, railroads,
and settlements, land was cleared of deer habitat.&#160; Lumbering,
grazing, uncontrolled burning of woodlands and the use of dogs were
all contributing factors&#160; (Cartwright, 1986, p.3). An additional
factor was market hunting, which was legal until 1915.&#160; Deer
that foraged in gardens and croplands were killed, including does and
fawns, and in many cases, only the hams were used, as the rest was
left to buzzards (Donaldson, p.13).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Old-timers have
told stories dating prior to 1900 when hunters would compete to see
who could kill the most deer.&#160; It is said that two good hunters
might kill from 50-60 deer in a 10 to 14-day period.&#160; When the
hunt was over, the hunter sometimes took the hams, but the rest was
left to rot.&#160; After deer became scarce, there was sometimes even
competition to see who could kill the last deer in a given area&#160;
(Donaldson, p.15).&#160; 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">The numbers of
whitetail declined to the point that sightings were a newsworthy
event.&#160; At the turn of the century, sightings were so rare that
newspapers would report on the front page that a deer was seen in the
community (Stout, p.1).&#160; By 1930, an estimated 500 animals were
all that remained of the once massive herd, and these were scattered
in isolated spots (Cartwright, p.3).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">&#160;The Arkansas
Game and Fish Commission was formed in 1915 (Cartwright, p.3), and in
1916 it placed a 61-day open season on deer.&#160; Other laws
followed, but the deer population continued dropping (Donaldson,
p.15) until it reached the lows of the early 1930's.&#160; 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Statistics kept by
the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission of .Arkansas Reported Deer
Harvest. date back to 1938, the first recorded year.&#160; In 1938,
203 deer were harvested (Appendix -Arkansas Game and Fish Table).&#160;
It must be kept in mind that these are <I>reported</I> deer
harvested.&#160; It is almost certain that the actual numbers taken
were somewhat higher, due to illegal hunting, failure to report,
etc., but this can be seen as the most reliable indicator available.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">The turning point
dated from the establishment of Arkansas. first game refuges in
1926-27.&#160; These refuges, along with better law enforcement,
began to show a positive effect in the numbers of whitetail deer.&#160;
In some counties, deer had been completely exterminated, and to even
be able to establish game refuges, deer had to be stocked there&#160;
(Donaldson, p.16).&#160; More than 40 state and federal refuges were
established and more than 3,000 deer were stocked&#160; (Crawford,
p.3).&#160; This was done either by obtaining deer from other states,
or trapping native animals from other areas in Arkansas.&#160; Those
trapped came from overpopulated areas and were moved into suitable
unoccupied range. Sometimes, individuals and organizations released a
few deer into the state&#160; (Donaldson, p. 16). 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">In 1942, the
number of deer harvested in Arkansas climbed to 1,000, reached 4,122
by 1950, 15,000 by 1960, 26,017 by 1970, 45,202 by 1980, and had
reached 152,460 by 1996, the last year for which figures are
available (Appendix - AG&amp;F Table).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Many processes
took place during those years to cause the dramatic population
changes.&#160; The public began to develop more favorable attitudes
toward all types of conservation (Donaldson, p.16).&#160; In a
General Election of the state on Nov. 7, 1944, Arkansas
Constitutional Amendment 35 established independence of the Arkansas
State Game and Fish Commission.&#160; The Commission saw as its goal
the&#160;&#160; .. . .control, management, restoration, conservation
and regulation of the birds, fish and wildlife resources of the State
. . . .&#160; The Commission exercises exclusive power over the
issuance of licenses, bag limits, and the manner of taking game and
fish, and also divides the state into zones.&#160; Additionally, it
oversees purchases and acquisitions of property for the purpose of
carrying out its missions&#160; (Arkansas Constitutional Amendment
#35).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">As of today, the
Commission has acquired approximately 325,000 acres and leases
another 300,000 acres from corporate private landowners.&#160; It
works cooperatively with the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, U.S. National Park Service, as well as other organizations
and private landowners .to enhance wildlife habitat on an additional
3.3 million acres.. (Arkansas Game and Fish, Harris, p.1).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">&#160;As
statistical evidence shows, the deer population in Arkansas has grown
substantially from the dismal lows reached in the early part of the
century.&#160; Just as man.s intervention has had an effect on the
deer population, so do the increased numbers of deer have an impact
on other animals, people, and the environment, and it is to this
topic that we now turn. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in"><B>Interactions of
Deer With Humans</B></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">.There are
dramatic ecological changes as deer populations grow,. according to
William Porter, a wildlife biologist at Syracuse University
(Budiansky, 1994, p.85).&#160; In Wisconsin, for example, rare
orchids and lilies are disappearing, and hardwoods and hemlocks have
failed to reproduce for 50 years.&#160; Deer have earned the name
.rats with antlers. from some corners.&#160; Deer are now present in
places where they haven.t been for more than 100 years, (Budiansky,
p.85) and there are nearly two times more deer in the lower 48 states
than there were a decade ago.&#160; In fact, their numbers may be up
as much as 5,000 percent since the turn of the century&#160; (Nelson,
p.36).&#160; 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">What does this
mean for Arkansas?&#160; As early as the 1940's, wildlife managers in
Arkansas recognized deer management problems due to .bucks only.
hunting and overprotection.&#160; In the state, federal and state
refuges became overpopulated with deer, resulting in deer losses due
to disease and starvation, as well as range destruction.&#160;
(Cartwright, p.3).&#160; 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">At that time,
overpopulation wasn.t yet a problem outside of preserves and
refuges.&#160; In 1946, the statewide deer population had grown to
31,617, and by 1954 had reached 150,000.&#160; Bucks-only hunting was
required until the early 1970's.&#160; This approach resulted in a
healthy, growing deer herd, as based on body size and antler
development.&#160; Numbers were well below what the habitat could
support (Cartwright, p.3).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">However, in the
late 1960's and 1970's, the deer herd began to exceed what the
habitat could support.&#160; The number of deer that a particular
habitat can support without deterioration of the habitat or the deer
is known as .carrying capacity..&#160; This varies according to the
geographical and biological features of a region.&#160; For example,
in the Ozark hills of north Arkansas, it may take 60 acres to support
one deer year-round, where in south Arkansas, 60 acres may support
six deer annually.&#160; In Arkansas, it became apparent that the
carrying capacity was being exceeded as evidenced by deterioration in
antler development, reduced reproduction, increased natural
mortality, an increase in parasites and disease, increased damage to
crops, and deterioration of habitat&#160; (Cartwright, p.3 ).&#160;
However, rather than these factors having a natural controlling
effect on the population of deer herds, the numbers of deer remain
high, while the health and quality of the animals remains low.&#160;
In the meantime, they are continuing to deplete habitat through
overbrowsing&#160; (Young p.7).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Studies done on
plants and trees under carefully controlled conditions in other
states indicate that there are significant reductions in tree
diversity and size, and that bark stripping by deer makes trees
susceptible to disease.&#160; Understory vegetation and seedlings are
affected by the loss of the taller trees above them.&#160; Seedlings
are unable to make the transition to saplings.&#160; When there is
insufficient regeneration of tree species, other animal species
regenerate less successfully.&#160; Overbrowsing by deer is cited as
the major cause of unsuccessful regeneration&#160; (Young, pp. 7-8).&#160;
A study by William McShea of the Smithsonian Institution on the
effects of increased deer populations in years when there is a small
acorn crop show reductions in the numbers of squirrels, chipmunks,
flying squirrels, wood rats, and mice due to competition for food.&#160;
He also speculates that the destruction of low-lying plants in the
understory eliminates habitat for the insects that birds feed on,
reducing bird populations, as well (Budiansky, p.86).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">In the mid 1980's,
the deer population in Arkansas was estimated at 400,000 to 500,000&#160;
(Cartwright, p.3).&#160; As with the rest of the nation, this many
deer in Arkansas were bound to affect humans, as well as have
consequences for the species itself.&#160; For one thing, as the
increased numbers of deer seek living space and food in areas
populated by humans, there will be increasing interaction on many
levels (Young, p.8).&#160; Problems cited from deer overpopulation
range from damage to crops and landscape plants, (Young, p.8) to
damage to golf courses (Budiansky, p.85).&#160; These occurrences
have a significant economic impact, as well (Young, p.9).&#160; Deer
populations also contribute to the spread of Lyme disease, which is
carried by deer ticks (Budiansky, p.86).&#160; More important are
highway accidents involving deer.&#160; It seems that in north
central Arkansas, nearly everyone has either been involved in an
accident with a deer, or knows someone who has, and the consequences
are potentially disastrous.&#160; 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">In August 1997, a
twin-engine plane taking off at the North Little Rock Municipal
Airport runway hit a deer, forcing the plane to make an emergency
landing in Jonesboro without the use of its landing gear, which had
been damaged.&#160; The deer died in the accident.&#160; There had
been two previous accidents within recent months at the airport
(Waller, Aug. 29, 1997, Section 1-B).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Whatever one.s
feelings about the beauty of deer and love for wildlife and nature,
there are clearly negative consequences of increased deer populations
in Arkansas and elsewhere.&#160; The following section will examine
the concept of managing deer populations to optimize coexistence
between deer and other species, including man. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in"><B>Managing Deer
Populations</B></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">The .wildlife
management. approach to the problem has become popular among
biologists, landowners, and hunters in recent years.&#160; While it
may be incomprehensible to animal rights groups, some of whom view
deer management as an issue of human convenience (Budiansky, p.86),
ecologists advocate the necessity of management as a means of
preserving other species and habitats.&#160; In Arkansas, under the
oversight of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission and Cooperative
Extension Service, management takes various forms.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Wildlife
management has .gone through a philosophical and technical evolution
since the turn of this century,. according to Rebecca Stout,
Extension Specialist-Wildlife with the University of Arkansas
Cooperative Extension Service (1999, p.1).&#160; A photo caption on
page 17&#160; in David Donaldson.s 1951 book, <U>Arkansas. Deer Herd</U>
expresses the long held view, .The legal hunter should receive the
benefit of all surplus deer.. (1951, p. 17).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Gathering
information from various sources, it appears that from initially
having the purpose of increasing deer herds to benefit hunters
(hence, the previous name of .game management.), wildlife management
now includes the viewpoints of conservationists, biologists,
ecologists, and the general public.&#160; While there are undoubtedly
hunters who still see hunting as the primary beneficiary of wildlife
management, biologists view hunting as just one of several tools for
maintaining the proper balance of deer due to the necessity of humans
sharing habitat with them. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">In Arkansas,
following the major restoration program begun in the early part of
the century, game management&#160; took the form of strict
enforcement of hunting regulations, restricted hunting seasons, and
.bucks only. hunting seasons (Cartwright, p.3).&#160; According to
Rebecca Stout, Ph.D. with the University of Arkansas Cooperative
Extension Service, .once deer populations were established, then
conservative hunting regulations and takings allowed the .surplus.
deer to be harvested, much like running a livestock operation..
(1999, p.1).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">As previously
stated, it became apparent as early as the 1940's that the potential
to exceed carrying capacity could occur, which indeed took place in
the 1960's and 1970's.&#160; In the 70's, losses in Arkansas. deer
herd due to disease were very heavy.&#160; Research on south
Arkansas. deer herd began to show imbalances in herd sex ratios,
meaning there were too many does for the number of bucks, as well as
poor physical condition of individuals, as determined by low body
weights and low quality antlers.&#160; Additionally, there was poor
herd age structure, meaning very few adult bucks over 2.5 years of
age.&#160; These problems were due to the .bucks only. hunting
seasons that had prevailed for years (Cartwright, p.4).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">It came to be seen
that heavy hunting pressure on bucks and too many deer for habitat
conditions were the main cause of management problems.&#160; The
solution was seen as reducing&#160; hunting pressure on bucks,
allowing more to reach adult age and size, and harvesting does
(Cartwright, p. 4).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">In the Ozarks of
north-central Arkansas, an area of traditionally lower deer
population densities, as recently as 1986, deer populations were
below carrying capacity, and it was necessary to continue
restrictions on legal either-sex hunting to allow populations to
increase.&#160; This area was also prone to more illegal hunting,
which further reduced numbers of deer (Cartwright, p. 4).&#160; 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Hunters had become
so used to the .bucks only. rules that changes proposed by biologists
were, and still are, difficult for many hunters to accept.&#160;
Again, according to Stout, .it has taken some time to change hunters.
philosophies that shooting does is a necessary part. of game
management&#160; (1999, p.1).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Arkansas divides
its deer herd into 20 zones.&#160; Zones are based on deer population
densities, habitat quality and distribution, human population
densities, physiographic features, and sociological and political
influences.&#160; A statewide deer management plan was developed and
adopted in 1981 by the Game and Fish Commission.&#160; This plan
includes management objectives which .can only be accomplished by
legal either-sex deer harvest in many areas of the state..&#160;
(Cartwright, p. 4).&#160; According to 1997 data, the most recent
available, 2,332 deer were harvested in Van Buren County and 3,467
from Cleburne counties.&#160; This compares to as many as 8,217 in
Union county, and ranges from four to six thousand in each of several
south-central Arkansas counties.&#160; Deer taken totaled 167,305, a
state record of 10% more than the previous year, and were composed of
63% bucks and 37% does. The 1997 deer season was the 81<SUP>st</SUP>
in Arkansas (Appendix - AG&amp;F Map).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Regardless of
one.s feelings about hunting, it cannot be argued that the ecological
impact of overpopulation has repercussions for all of us.&#160;
William Porter estimates that without hunting, deer populations would
be five times what they are presently (Budiansky, p.86).&#160;
Nonlethal alternatives to hunting have been tried in some areas, but
the costs of trapping and removal, assuming someone can be found to
take the animals, run $600 a head.&#160; It would be necessary to
treat at least 80% of the entire female population with contraceptive
surgical implants or immunizations to be effective, and this would
cost from $500 to $1,000 per head (Budiansky, p.86).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Moral issues
aside, with such figures, it becomes clear that involving hunters in
wildlife management is a necessity.&#160; Many hunters follow a code
of ethics, as set down by tradition and by such organizations as the
.Boone and Crockett Club,. founded in 1887 by Theodore Roosevelt.&#160;
Its goals include not only .to promote manly sport with the rifle,.
but .to work for the preservation of the wild animal life of this
country,. among others.&#160; With its well known .Rules of Fair
Chase. (defined as .the ethical, sportsmanlike and lawful pursuit and
taking of any free-ranging wild game animal in a manner that does not
give the hunter an improper or unfair advantage over such game
animals,. and which lists such methods),&#160; Boone and Crockett
promotes hunting sportsmanship, ethics, and laws (Boone &amp;
Crockett, p.4).&#160; Many hunters view themselves as
.hunter-conservationists. or guardians of not only wildlife, but
habitat. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in"><B>&#160;</B>Aside
from official, state-sanctioned laws and practices, private
landowners, hunters, and individuals have an impact on the habitat
and numbers of whitetail deer. <B>&#160;</B>It is a growing trend for
hunter-landowners and non-hunting landowners in Arkansas to have an
impact on the physical habitat of whitetail deer through habitat
improvement practices.&#160; This takes the form of supplementing
deer diets through food plots, which are planted in crops designed to
enhance deer health, and creating or improving existing habitat.&#160;
Some landowners plant trees that provide shelter, a canopy, browse,
and mast (nuts accumulated on the forest floor - Webster, 1995).&#160;
Selective logging is also done to enhance habitat.&#160; Sometimes,
blown down trees are left to make bedding sites thicker (Amenrud).&#160;
The Arkansas Extension Service provides landowners with information
on how to construct brush piles for deer and other wildlife to use as
resting and escape cover (Bratton, p.1).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">&#160;As far as
our research can determine, it was as recent as the early 1980's that
biologists believed there to be no significant impact on deer herd
size or quality of individuals from .farming. for whitetails.&#160;
When, in 1983, Dr. Gary Schwarz, of the now famed Tecomate Ranch in
South Texas approached wildlife managers and range scientists with
his idea of intensively managing his ranch to produce trophy
whitetails through the right combination of plants in the proper
size, shape, and distribution of food plots, he was told that it
could never work.&#160; Biologists at the time were convinced that
supplemental feeding of deer was a waste of time and money&#160;
(Schwarz, Nov./Dec. 1998, p.72).&#160; Results on the Tecomate Ranch
have proven otherwise, and wildlife management as it pertains to deer
has reached nationwide proportions.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Dr. Schwarz.s
ranch developed their own special formula seed mix called .LabLab.
which works successfully in Texas.&#160; Other companies have
developed and are marketing their own mixes, including special clover
mixes.&#160; One term used to describe such plantings are
.greenfields,. which refers to special plantings designed to lure
deer and turkeys on their daily feeding rounds&#160; (Fegely, p.1).
&#160;In Arkansas, the Cooperative Extension Service makes
information about pasture, hay, winter cover crops, and legumes
available to interested landowners, and provides federal funds to
cost-share the implementation of it (Davis).&#160; They provide
information about varieties that work well in specific areas, as well
as providing seeding rates and dates.&#160; They also supply
information from seed companies that have wild game food lists and
ordering information, (Deauman - Table, Kaufman-Seeds - .Wild Game
Food List.) but it is up to individual landowners to develop a&#160;
program on their own land.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">&#160;In some
states, county deer management cooperatives have been formed with the
stated goal of improving .the health of the deer herd through
biologically sound harvest management,. as in Kent County, Maryland.&#160;
Record-keeping and the sharing of data is an essential element of
such a program (Knauss, Jan. 30, 1998).&#160; Dooly County, Georgia
was the first in the nation to be chosen to try quality deer
management on a countywide scale (Thurmond, 1998, p. 80).&#160; In
Arkansas, information about food plots and ground cover is provided
by the Cooperative Extension Service, and books on management are
available for purchase and in libraries through the Arkansas Game and
Fish Commission, but the actual development of a management plan lies
with the initiative of individual landowners, and is therefore rather
scattered.&#160; Still, there is good effort to make the public aware
of opportunities in wildlife management.&#160; For example, on Feb.
13, 1999, a Wildlife Habitat Improvement Workshop was held in
Fayetteville, featuring nationally known speakers in the field, and
addressing methods of managing pastures, grasslands, and forests,
establishing food plots and regenerating native food plants, as well
as habitat improvement through prescribed burning, tree cutting, tree
thinning, etc.&#160; (Extension Service flyers).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">It is interesting
to note that in spite of such efforts, according to Rebecca Stout,
PhD., there is debate among wildlife biologists about the value of
food plots.&#160; She states, .Unless food plots are carefully
planned to provide a year-round food supply, they may do little to
improve deer populations, health, and survivability.&#160; Planting a
fall food plot might congregate the deer so that hunters have a
better chance of harvesting one, but the most critical time for
survival for deer tends to be about February or March following a
harsh winter.&#160; To have even a marginal impact on the deer
population, food plots need to be planted so that it provides food
for deer at that critical time.&#160; Therefore, basing changes in
the deer population and its health on food plots may also be
erroneous..&#160; (Stout, pp. 1-2).&#160; However, research on Texas.
Tecomate Ranch does seem to indicate that both populations and
individuals are enhanced through wildlife management practices
(Schwarz, p.156).&#160; Additionally, according to Dr. Wiley Johnson,
Agronomist and Director of Forage Research at the Whitetail Institute
of North America in Pintlala, AL, proper nutrition determines antler
growth as well as healthy fawn production.&#160; He concurs with Dr.
Stout that food plots that become dormant in late winter and spring
are not as effective as the year-round availability of the proper
nutrient mix (Fegely, p.3).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">Using information&#160;
available in Arkansas and from other sources, the Longfield Deer Camp
on Culpepper Mountain in Van Buren County began a program of
selective harvesting, record-keeping, food plots, and mineral
supplementation.&#160; .Every year that we.ve harvested doe, we have
seen more deer each year beyond that.&#160; This year, in the last
day of the season, I sat on my stand and saw 12 deer around me, for
the first time in 18 years.&#160; Three were mature bucks, and one
was a young buck,. said Mark Davis, D.D.S., who began the program.
(Dr. Davis is herein quoted in his capacity as a nationally published
author in hunting magazines, as well as his knowledge of hunting and
wildlife management.)&#160; Although he could have legally taken any
of these deer, as a wildlife manager, Dr. Davis chose not to take any
of them.&#160; Dr. Davis states that in the same way that young
calves are not slaughtered, it is unwise to harvest young deer.&#160;
.If you harvest mature deer, you still have a thriving population.&#160;
Food plots are crucial for deer, particularly after the rut, when
male deer have depleted their fat and muscle mass.&#160; If there
were no food plots or browse for them to feed on at the end of the
rut, near the end of December, there would be nothing for them to
eat.&#160; By that time, much of the acorns and browse have been
consumed.&#160; Although deer in Arkansas could get by, they will not
prosper..&#160; It is interesting to note that in this camp, the food
plots are winter hardy and support the deer through the crucial
periods cited by researchers.&#160; Additionally, these plots support
the deer throughout the year, and not just during the fall hunting
season.&#160; Dr. Davis states that not only do food plots help deer,
but all other creatures in the food chain benefit from a sound and
complete nutritional diet.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">The Longfield Deer
Camp has kept records for the past five years.&#160; .We.ve noticed
that as we.ve taken does, the population has not decreased.&#160;
There are definitely more sightings..&#160; The camp has aged the
deer harvested for the past two years, and is working constantly to
educate themselves.&#160; Practicing game management has required
members to hunt differently than they have for all of their lives
(Davis).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 0.33in">It is undeniable
that the area of north-central Arkansas has seen a dramatic increase
in its whitetail deer population.&#160; According to Mike Cartwright,
deer and elk coordinator for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission,
.The Ozarks are really coming on strong as far as deer numbers..&#160;
Hunters and residents of the area provide evidence of this fact in
numbers of deer harvested, (Bowman, Nov. 12/ 1996, Section C) in
sightings of animals, in damage to gardens and shrubbery by foraging
deer, and in vehicle accidents with deer.&#160; While numbers of deer
in north central Arkansas are not usually considered so excessive as
to pose an acute problem, it is only through the efforts of
landowners and hunters, in cooperation with biologists and our state
agencies, that a proper balance is being achieved.&#160; This balance
is necessary to allow the continued prosperity of all interacting
species.&#160;
