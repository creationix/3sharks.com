<center><h2>"What is an earthquake and its relation to Arkansas?</h2></center>
<P>            Many people believe that earthquakes are scarce
throughout Arkansas. However, Arkansas has a very active seismic zone
and has been touched by earthquake activity throughout the years (See
Figure 1a; 1b). There have been several earthquakes documented in
Arkansas from 1811 until 1988. Causes of earthquakes, measurement of
earthquakes, and history of earthquakes in Arkansas are all very
important in understanding what an earthquake is and why they occur
in Arkansas.</P>
<P>            The crust of the Earth is floating on the mantle,
which is moving melted rock. The movements of the crust over many
years has cracked it into many pieces called plates. The plates then
float about on the mantle slowly. Sometimes they run into or pull
away from each other, causing strains in the rocks along the edges of
the plates. The plates that collide with each other are what causes
most earthquakes, although they can occur anywhere that rocks are
under stress (Simon, 1991). According to Shedlock and Pakiser, the
crust bends first, then when the stress exceeds the strength of the
rocks, the crust breaks and &quot;snaps&quot; into a new position. It
is during this process that seismic waves are generated. They are
vibrations that travel outward from the source of the earthquake
along the surface (surface waves) and through the Earth (body waves).
(Shedlock and Pakiser, http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq1/ ). Depending
on the material through which the waves are moving, the speed at
which they move varies. Surface waves usually have the strongest
vibrations and probably cause most of the damage done by earthquakes.
 Although some of these vibrations are at a high enough frequency to
be heard, others are of very low frequency and are not audible. The
vibrations cause the entire planet to quiver, and sometimes ring like
a bell (Shedlock and Pakiser, http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq1/ ). 
</P>
<P>            &quot;A fault is a fracture in the Earth's crust along
which two blocks of the crust have slipped with respect to each
other&quot; (Shedlock and Pakiser,
http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq1/).  For many years earthquakes were
believed to be the cause of occurring faults in the earth. In 1891,
Professor B. Koto wrote, &quot;It can be confidently asserted that
the sudden faulting was the actual cause (and not the effect) of the
earthquake.&quot; People did not agree with this for some time
because the victims of the earthquakes could not see the difference
between the cause and effect of the earthquake. The result was the
same either way (Halacy, 1974). 
</P>
<P>             Shedlock and Pakiser explain that there are three
types of faults: normal faults, thrust (reverse) faults, and
strike-slip (lateral) faults (See Figure 2a; 2b; 2c) . &quot;Normal
faults occur in response to pulling or tension; the overlying block
moves down the dip of the fault plane. Thrust (reverse) faults occur
in response to squeezing or compression; the overlying block moves up
the dip of the fault plane. Strike-slip (lateral) faults occur in
response to either type of stress; the blocks move horizontally past
one another. Most faulting along spreading zones is normal, along
subduction zones is thrust, and along transform faults is
strike-slip&quot; (Shedlock and Pakiser,
http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq1/).</P>
<P>            According to Halacy, the Earth trembles sufficiently
to produce a shock every thirty seconds on the average. About a
million earthquakes rock our planet each year. There have already
been over a million deaths this century, along with great suffering
and damage, caused by the destructive force of great blocks of the
Earth's crust on a rampage (Halacy, 1974).  
</P>
<P>Measuring earthquakes is complicated because the size cannot be
estimated by the damage to buildings or the number of people killed.
For this reason, scientists use seismographs, which are instruments
used to measure earthquake shocks (Simon, 1991).  Scientists also use
the Richter scale, developed by Charles F. Richter in 1935. It is a
mathematical device used to compare the size of earthquakes. &#147;The
magnitude of an earthquake is determined from the logarithm of the
amplitude of waves recorded by seismographs&#148; ( USGS,
http://gldss7.cr.usgs.gov/neis/general/handouts/richter.html).  When
using the Richter Scale, magnitude is measured and expressed in whole
numbers and decimal fractions. The higher the magnitude, the stronger
the earthquake. A 6.9 earthquake does more damage than a 5.4
earthquake. Each whole number increase is a tenfold  increase in
amplitude and a release of about 31 times more energy than the
preceding number (USGS,
<A HREF="http://gldss7.cr.usgs.gov/neis/general/handouts/richter.html">http://gldss7.cr.usgs.gov/neis/general/handouts/richter.html</A>).
 Some earthquakes are very small and may not be felt by people. They
can only be recorded by local seismographs, and usually have a
reading of 2.0 or less. These are called microearthquakes. An
earthquake with a magnitude of 4.5 of higher are strong enough to be
recorded all over the world by sensitive seismographs. The largest
earthquakes recorded have had a magnitude in the 8.8 to 8.9 range
(USGS, <A HREF="http://gldss7.cr.usgs.gov/neis/general/handouts/richter.html">http://gldss7.cr.usgs.gov/neis/general/handouts/richter.html</A>).
When the Richter Scale was first invented, Charles F Richter himself
stated, &#147; I did the work to provide a purely instrumental scale
for rough separation of large, medium and small shocks&#148; (Bolt,
1988). However, it has grown since that time. The method describes an
earthquake by using only one number. In order for this to be
efficient, the method has had to be extended to apply to a number of
different seismographs throughout the world. There are now a variety
of magnitude scales based on different formulas for the distance the
earthquake travels from its center. The Richter Scale measures the
amplitude. Once it is read, scientists, engineers, and technicians
recognize the number as a measure of the size of the earthquake and
how severe it is. Then, magnitudes of previous earthquakes are used
to determine what the greatest acceleration of the waves may be at a
certain place so that engineers may design a structure in that
particular place to withstand an earthquake (Bolt,1988).  In 1811,
Arkansas was hit by the New Madrid Earthquakes. The New Madrid Fault
is a primary fault 2 to 20 miles below land surface (See Figure 3a;
3b). It extends 150 miles southward from Cairo, Illinois, through New
Madrid and Caruthersville, Missouri, and down through Batesville to
Marked Tree, Arkansas. It dips into Kentucky, near Fulton, and
extends southeast to Dyersburg, Tennessee. The New Madrid Earthquakes
caused rivers to run backwards, snapped cypress forests into
splinters, and even made towns disappear (Fuller, 1984). Also, Lake
Catherine, a forty mile long and a half mile wide Arkansas lake, was
formed by these quakes  (USGS,
<A HREF="http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/states/arkansas/arkansas_history.html">http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/states/arkansas/arkansas_history.html</A>).
On December 16,1811, just west of Blytheville, Arkansas, the ground
rumbled and cracked, causing one of the most disastrous earthquakes
that is known (See Figure 4). The ground rose and fell as the earth
waved, opening the soil in the deep cracks as the surface was bent.
During December 16 and 17, 1811, shocks continued at short intervals,
but gradually diminished in intensity. The earthquakes epicentral
zone encompassed southeastern  Missouri and northeastern Arkansas.
This region was unlike any other part of the territory. Taken as a
whole, the area was characterized by a series of lowland beds divided
from one another by ridges running in a southern direction. Some of
this bottomland was poorly drained or not drained at all, but these
areas were not swamps (Mueller, 1972).   Crowley&#146;s Ridge is the
largest of the ridges that were formed from the bottomland (See
Figure 5). It arose at a point 35 miles west of the Ohio junction and
stretched one hundred miles further into Arkansas. Of all the
phenomena of the earthquake, none filled people with more fascinated
horror than fissuring. This was due to the scary thought of being
sucked into the earth and being buried alive. There are two kinds of
fissures in the earthquake zone, one due to the down-faulting of
narrow strips of earth, and the other to the cracking of the soil by
tension as rocks begin to cool. The first caused wide depressions,
but not the gaping chasms of the narratives. Those were produced by
the second type and produced the greatest alarm (Mueller, 1972).
Liquefaction may also occur. It takes place when sediments at or near
the ground loose strength due to strong ground shaking (MCEER,
http://nceer.eng.buffalo.edu/faqs/liq.html). For a full year from
December 16, 1811, small shocks occurred at intervals of a few days,
but as there were no other shocks, the people became accustomed to
the vibrations, and gave little attention to them (Mueller, 1972).
The New Madrid Fault Zone averages more than 200 earthquakes per
year. Of these earthquakes, 8 to 10 are large enough to be felt.
There are approximately 46 earthquakes in the 2.0 range and 7 in the
3.0 range per year. The possibility of a great earthquake happening
soon in this area is small. Scientists believe that catastrophic
events like those of 1811 happen in the New Madrid region every 550
to 1200 years. This means there is a 0.3% to 1.0% probability of an
event greater than magnitude 8.0 within the next 15 years. Even
though the chances are small, there have been other damaging
earthquakes in the area since 1811 and 1812 (USGS,
http://www.neic.cr.usgs.gov/iso.html). Another earthquake occurred in
December of 1883 near Melbourne, which is about 95 miles northeast of
Little Rock (See Figure 6). Rockslides occurred and buildings shook.
In March of 1911, a shock struck Pine Bluff. It excited many citizens
who ran in the street in panic. The record notes, &#147;Glasses were
shaken from counters in confectionery stores, and dishes were broken
in many kitchens&#148; (USGS,
<A HREF="http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/states/arkansas/arkansas_history.html">http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/states/arkansas/arkansas_history.html</A>).
In 1928, Arkansas was struck by 2 shocks. In November, a shock that
appeared to come from the west struck Black Rock, Arkansas (See
Figure 7). Again in December, Black Rock was hit with an earthquake
that &#147;caused the windows to rattle&#148; (Jackson, 1979). In
1937 and 1938, very light tremors were noted in the northeastern part
of the state. The tremors were felt over 25,000 and 90,000 square
miles of Arkansas and several surrounding states. Luckily, neither
one of those earthquakes caused damage. In January of 1955, a quake
occurred in northeastern Arkansas near the Missouri-Tennessee border.
This early morning earthquake affected some property in the
surrounding states, and it awoke hundreds of residents (USGS,
<A HREF="http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/states/arkansas/arkansas_history.html">http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/states/arkansas/arkansas_history.html</A>).
 In May of 1960, another quake struck Pine Bluff, Arkansas (See
Figure 8) . This tremor was felt by many. Houses shook and bottles
rattled, and a nearby building shook for 2 seconds (Jackson, 1979). A
tremor centered about 19 miles of northwest of Little Rock in January
of 1969. This tremor caused plaster to crack and furniture to be
moved in some homes. Residents in Missouri and Tennessee also took
note of this shock (USGS,
http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/states/arkansas/arkansas_history.html).
In December of 1988, a small earthquake struck northwest Arkansas.
The quake occurred about 8.98 km south of Blytheville and it had a
2.4 on the Richter Scale (UALR,
<A HREF="http://quake.ualr.edu/news/index.htm">http://quake.ualr.edu/news/index.htm</A>).
 Anywhere rocks are under pressure, an earthquake can occur. The
Richter Scale helps measure these earthquakes, and in some cases may
be helpful in predicting future quakes. Arkansas has had several
earthquakes in the past couple of centuries, and by looking at the
very active seismic zone, there may be more to come. Still, many
people believe you have to be in California to catch the quake
action. However, as evidence proves, Arkansans do get a taste every
once in a while!
