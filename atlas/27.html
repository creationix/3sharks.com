<P>How does the lumber industry in Arkansas effect the forest areas and animal habitats throughout the state?  How does this treatment coincide with the nationwide and worldwide view on deforestation (industrialism) versus environmentalism?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;In the United States today only fourteen-percent of the country’s forests are exclusively protected from being cut down.  This is in relation to only four percent of the entire world’s population (Arkansas Forestry Commission, 1990).  The human inhabitants of the planet, our country, and the state of Arkansas must decide between saving what is left of their forests and industrializing.  While attempts are made at having both, it ultimately depends upon many factors for different areas of the world before they decide which they would rather have, trees or smokestacks.  Arkansas being a state that was once rich in heavily wooded areas has seemingly chosen industry over environment.  Ninety percent of all bottomland hardwood forests in the state have been removed by the state’s lumber industry (Arkansas Forestry Commission, 1990).</P>
<P>&#9;This type of deforestation was once the only common form in the United States (Council of Environmental Quality, 1994-95).  With the economic benefits causing everyone from state legislatures to lumber companies and even stock-holders to see dollar signs instead of beauty; it is no wonder many of the nations forests were bulldozed long before the idea of environmentalism occurred to anyone.  But now companies and farmers are encouraged to plant where they cut (Council of Environmental Quality, 1994-95).  Before humans could think of conservation they only saw the short-term benefits of cutting down the forests and using up the land.  This shortsightedness has created a billion-dollar industry that has proven hard to reverse or improve upon.</P>
<P>&#9;Deforestation is justifiable when thinking only of its economic benefits.  It creates millions of jobs, companies like Georgia Pacific employs thousands locally, and millions nationally (Georgia Pacific, 1998).  Many smaller towns like Crossett and El Dorado rely heavily on the manufacturing operations of large corporations like Georgia Pacific to keep the locals employed.  The lumber industry is also responsible for one of America’s chief exports to Asian nations, wood and paper (Bergman &amp; Renwick, 1999).  Without our country exporting the goods, we would have to spend the money to have it imported to us.  This is not something that America’s Congress wants to do; spend money on a product they could readily obtain from their own states.  This economic frame of thought is even more important on a state funding level.  Arkansas’s income due to its forests is almost two billion dollars annually (Arkansas, 1990).  The state’s forests are worth more than twelve billion dollars, something no state legislature would want to let slip away from them (Arkansas, 1990).</P>
<P>&#9;The short-term benefits of industrializing are sometimes overwhelming enough to make people forget what impact a forest has on the Earth, locally and internationally.  This is because a forest’s benefits are not something as concrete as money; you can not hold what they give to the world in your wallet.  This is an example of externalities: The belief what one person does effects the whole (Bergman &amp; Renwick, 1999).  Forests are responsible for storing carbon, reducing erosion, aiding in flood protection, not to mention they are habitats for half of the world’s species (Bergman &amp; Renwick, 1999).  Carbon levels in the air have become great concern for environmentalists throughout the world due to the debate over the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer (Calvin, 1998).  The amounts of trees we keep on the planet greatly reduce both of those threats to our ecosystem.  Soil erosion is a potentially big problem due to farming in the country but is being controlled by the Conservation reserve program (CRP) which imposes rules, regulations and financial incentives to farmers (Council of Environmental Quality, 1992-93).  If the soil is not able to soak up the precipitation, then water cannot reach the underground aquifers from which most people obtain it.  Flood protection is a concern for the state of Arkansas which trees can help ease.  With the proximity of the Arkansas River there is always a threat of flood (Video: Nova &quot;Flood!&quot;).</P>
<P>&#9;The mid-west experienced tremendous floods in the early nineties, which were partly due to the fact that much of the land that had been forest was made into cropland (Video: Nova &quot;Flood!&quot;).  This reduced the amount of protection the populace along the banks of the river had against the flood.  Not only had deforestation claimed valuable areas of woodlands which were home to many American species it has also destroyed animals on a global scale, most notably in the rainforests.  The destruction of the rainforests in South America is what really touched off the environmental debate in the late eighties (Bergman &amp; Renwick, 1999).  Facts began to emerge about the harmful effects the lumber industry and global corporations were having on the environment.</P>
<P>&#9;Though there have always been people interested in protecting the environment, they did not have a strong political voice until late in the century.  &quot;From George Perkins Marsh’s observation in 1864 in the landmark work <I>Man and Nature</I> that, &quot;the too general felling of the woods has been recognized as the most destructive among the many causes of the physical deterioration of the Earth&quot; to protests in 1996 over continued logging of old growth trees, debate over how to balance commercial harvest of trees with other uses and values associated with America’s forests continues&quot; (Council of Environmental Quality 1994-95).  Also in the 1870’s &quot;federal involvement in managing forests began (Council of Environmental Quality, 1994-95).  &quot;Gifford Pinchot became the first Chief of the Forest Service.  He strongly believed in use of forest resources for timber, but insisted on professional standards, based on the best science available, not, in his words, &quot;forest butchery&quot; (Council of Environmental Quality, 1994-95).  A strong voice in politics is important because that is how citizens are informed and how things get done to further the environmental cause.  The United States has the US Forest Service (USFS) to guard against any unlawful deforestation and they also protect national parks.  The official policy of the U.S.F.S. when it comes to how much forest a lumber company can cut is &quot;sustained yield&quot; management (Bergman &amp; Renwick, 1999).  This is a strategy that believes in maintaining the productivity of a resource even as it is being used.  The forestry requirement is that the number of trees harvested can not exceed the number of trees replaced by new growth (Bergman &amp; Renwick, 1999).  This policy minimizes soil erosion and increases the ability of a forest to replenish itself.  Though the government of Brazil is under worldwide scrutiny for its policy of allowing the continued deforestation of its rainforests, the process has not yet stopped.  The reason it has not yet been stopped is mostly due to the fact they still can not see past the dollar signs American Corporations continues to give them as our government negotiates with them to quit.</P>
<P>&#9;Though both the national government and the state of Arkansas are involved in steps to regulate the lumber industry, it will never be completely finished.  In Arkansas almost two million acres of forest are reserved for the sole purpose of keeping them safe for environmental purposes and recreation (Arkansas Forestry Commission, 1990).  Billions of acres around the country are saved for national parks and animal habitats.   Figure one shows the national forest lands, grasslands, and parks designated in the country (USFS, 1998).  Each government, local and national, has realized that conservation is necessary and can even be economically beneficial as well.  Almost as much money is made off of national parks every year as is made by cutting the forests down (Bergman &amp; Renwick, 1999).  The money though only goes to the government and not the corporations, who stand to continue to make billions every year if they are not carefully restricted.</P>
<P>&#9;The Arkansas legislature under Bill Clinton was heavily supportive of preserving, and expanding the forest regions in the state.  Their cause was helped greatly when Clinton became president with his V.P. Al Gore under the banner of the environmental presidency.  Clinton said, &quot;Maintaining and enhancing our environment, passing on a clean world to future generations, is a sacred obligation of citizenship.  We all have an interest in clean air, pure tap water, safe-food and protected national treasures.  Our environment is, quite literally, our common ground (Council of Environmental Quality, 1994-95)&quot;.  Though Arkansas has not drastically clear-cut its forests, it has grown far from the Natural State.  Its cities continue to grow, roads are continually being added onto, and companies like Bell Atlantic keep making more money.  Fortunately the environmental interest groups, on both levels, have a strong voice in their respective capitals, so if deforestation won’t stop completely it will at least have a watchful eye monitoring it.</P>
