<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">As
we travel down the congested roads filled with construction and
notice the development along the highway, we are forced to ask
ourselves the question, &#147;Is Arkansas growing?&#148;  If it is,
then how and why is it growing, and is it a fast growth or moderate
growth?  To frame this question and give perspective, many different
elements should be represented. The topics in which we will be
discussing will include the present and past population growth of
Arkansas. This will give us a good start as to how people have
settled into Arkansas and how the population is growing. The next
area of focus will be the current and past status of the Central
Arkansas Counties and the reason why we picked them. The final area
will be the economic status of Arkansas compared to the nation and
why companies should move, start, or expand in Arkansas. So the
question is, will the south rise again?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><B>POPULATION GROWTH
OF ARKANSAS</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Arkansas had a
population of 2.523 million residents in July, 1997
(http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/county/co-97-1_15.txt). 
The newest county population estimates recently released by the
Bureau of the Census show continued population growth of Arkansas
with a total growth of 172,195 (a growth rate of 7.3 percent) between
1990 and 1997 (http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/research/popest.html).  In
fact, the Institute for Economic Advancement states that the growth
is more than double the 64,000 (a growth rate of 3.0 percent) growth
that had occurred during the 1980-1990 years.  The Institute for
Economic Advancement states that the state will keep continuing its
population increases&#151;from 2,350,725 in 1990 to 2,547,800 people
in 2010 (http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/research/projann.html).  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><B>PAST POPULATON
GROWTH OF ARKANSAS </B>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	To set the current
population growth of Arkansas into context, we looked at the state&#146;s
past growth.  All of the statistics in this section are from
Gunderson (1986).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">From
1960 to 1970 Arkansas&#146;s population increased by 7.7%, and during
the 1970&#146;s the rate of growth accelerated to 18.9%.  In the
1950&#146;s, the population declined everywhere in Arkansas except in
the Urban Region.  In the Urban Region, the population increased from
1950 to 1980.  From 1960 to 1980 the population increased in the
Ozark, Arkansas River Valley, Northwest, West, and Southwest regions
(see Figures 1 and 2).  In the Northeast, Southeast, and South
regions, the population continued to decline from 1960 to 1970 but
rose in the 1970&#146;s.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Arkansas&#146;s
rural population patterns are similar to those for the total
population except in the Northeast, Southeast, and South regions (see
Figs. 3 and 4).  The rural population of the Northeast Region
declined from 1960 to 1970, then it grew 1.1% from 1970 to 1980.  The
rural population of the South Region rose 4.5% overall during the
1970&#146;s, though it dropped in four of the counties in this
region.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	The farm population
in Arkansas fell 47.6% during the 1960&#146;s and it fell another 38%
during the 1970&#146;s (see Figs. 5 and 6).  Perry County had the
only increase in farm population during the 1960&#146;s, but it lost
37.2% of its farm population from 1970 to 1980.  The largest rates of
decline in farm population were in the Northeast, Southeast, and
South regions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	The decline in
Arkansas&#146;s rural population was exceeded only in Mississippi
during the 1960&#146;s.  Rural population increased in all of
Arkansas&#146;s neighboring states during the 1970&#146;s.  Texas and
Oklahoma&#146;s population grew the most rapidly-27.3% and 20.9%,
respectively, from 1970 to 1980.  Louisiana had the regional low at
6.8%.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Total population
grew in all of these states from 1960 to 1980, but at different
rates.  Arkansas&#146;s total population growth rates appeared to be
the median within the southeastern United States.  In the 1960&#146;s
Mississippi had the slowest rate of growth (1.8%) and Texas had the
most rapid (16.9%).  During the 1970&#146;s Texas&#146; total
population still grew more rapidly than any of these states:  27.1%. 
Missouri had the slowest growth rate in the 1970&#146;s; and the
rates for Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma were similar to each
other.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	From 1975 to 1980,
25 counties had net out-migrations of population.  Seventeen of these
counties were in the Northeast and Southeast regions.  Phillips
County had a net out-migration of 3,326 people.  Mississippi County
lost 2,642 people, and St. Francis County lost 2,217.  Drew and
Lonoke were the only counties in the Southeast Region with net
in-migrations.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Four counties in
the South Region had net out-migrations.  In the six other regions,
only Perry, Newton, Pike, and Lafayette counties had net
out-migrations.  Benton and Washington counties, both in the
Northwest Region, had the largest net in-migrations:  11,670 and
9,265 people, respectively.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><B>CURRENT AND PAST
STATUS OF THE COUNTIES OF FOCUS</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	This portion of the
report deals with the current status of population, personal and
family economics, and poverty in central Arkansas.  The six counties
we chose to focus on are: Faulkner, Lonoke, Monroe, Praire, Pulaski
and Saline (see Fig. 7).  The Arkansas State Highway and
Transportation Department, Planning Division, divides the state into
development and planning districts with certain counties in each
district (Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department,
Planning Division).  We used this division of counties to determine
which counties to study. We also chose the central Arkansas area
because that is where everyone in the group lives</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Though
the labor force statistics begin at age 16, we felt that this was not
an accurate age to use, therefore we decided that 18 years of age was
a better starting point for labor force numbers and 64 years of age
was a better ending point.  The current labor force range according
to the Bureau of Census, U.S. Department of Commerce starts at age 16
and ends at infinity when the person dies
(http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/csdc/cntyprofiles).  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	The poverty status
was determined for all persons except those institutionalized, in
military group quarters, in college dormitories, and other unrelated
individuals under the age of 15.  These statistics were based on the
definition given by the Social Security Administration in 1964, then
modified by Federal interagency committees in 1969 and 1980,
prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget
(http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/csdc/cntyprofiles).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Faulkner County
currently has a total population of 60,006 (Figure 8).  It is 55.9
percent rural and 44.1 percent urban.  Over 68 percent of the
county's population falls in the 18 to 64 year old category which is
the prime age category for employment.  Roughly 47 percent of
Faulkner county residents are employed and over 59 percent of the
persons of age to work are employed.  Unfortunately, Faulkner County
is still at or near 7 percent unemployment
(http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/csdc/cntyprofiles).  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	In 1991, Faulkner
County had a per capita income of $13,699 a year, which was a 47 %
increase over the 1983 per capita income of $7,267. In 1996, Faulkner
County enjoyed a mean yearly household income of $28,064. Currently,
Faulkner county has 10 percent of its families under the poverty
level and 13.8 percent poverty overall
(http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/csdc/cntyprofiles).  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Lonoke County
currently has a total population of 39,268 (Figure 8).  It is 60
percent rural and 40 percent urban.  Slightly fewer than 60 percent
of the county's population falls in the 18 to 64 year old category,
which is the prime age category for employment.  Roughly 44 percent
of Lonoke county residents are employed and just under 60 percent of
the persons of age to work are employed.  Lonoke County is still at
or near 6.4 percent unemployment
(http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/csdc/cntyprofiles).  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	In 1991, Lonoke
County has a per capita income of $12,725 a year, this is a 35% jump
in per capita income from 1983 when it was a mere $8,354. In 1996,
Lonoke County ended the year with mean yearly household income of
$28,885.  Unfortunately, Lonoke county currently has 11.4 percent of
its families under the poverty level and 14.9 percent poverty overall
(http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/csdc/cntyprofiles).  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Monroe County
currently has a total population of 60,006 (Figure 8).  It is 55.9
percent rural and 44.1 percent urban.  Over 68 percent of the
county's population falls in the 18 to 64 year old category which is
the prime age category for employment.  Roughly 47 percent of Monroe
county residents are employed and over 59 percent of the persons of

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	In 1991, Monroe
County has a per capita income of $13,699 a year, this is a 33%
increase from the 1983 per capita income level of $7,180.  In 1996,
Monroe County ended with a mean yearly household income of $28,064. 
Currently, Monroe County has 10 percent of its families under the
poverty level and 13.8 percent poverty overall
(http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/csdc/cntyprofiles).  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Pulaski County
currently has a total population of 349,660 (Figure 8).  It is 89
percent urban and 11 percent rural.  These large numbers for both
population and population concentration should come as no surprise
considering Pulaski county is home to the state's capitol and largest
city, Little Rock.  Over sixty percent of the county's population
falls in the 18 to 64 year old category, which is the prime age
category for employment.  Consequently, roughly 50 percent of Pulaski
county residents are employed and over 80 percent of the persons of
age to work are employed.  Pulaski County is still hovering at or
near 5 percent unemployment
(http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/csdc/cntyprofiles).

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	In 1991, Pulaski
County has a per capita income of $16,665 a year, this is a 38%
increase  from 1983 when the per capita income was at $10,368.  In
1996, Pulaski County enjoyed a robust mean yearly household income of
$34,770.  Needless to say Pulaski County currently has a low percent
of families under the poverty level at 10.5 percent.  The average
poverty level for a family of four in Pulaski County is $12,678

<H2>ECONOMIC STATUS OF ARKANSAS</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">When
we discuss growth, economic development is extremely paramount. The
population demographics of Arkansas consist of things like income and
poverty rates. The population when dealing with income is comprised
of three levels, poor, near poor, and non-poor. The percentages of
these are 17%, 26.2%, and 56.6% respectively. The percentages when
compared to the United States as a whole only change slightly to
15.4%, 20%, and 64.7% respectively.  These numbers indicate that
Arkansas is on course with the nation. The poverty rates of Arkansas
are broken into three categories; children under age 19, 24%, adults
ages 19-64, 12.4%, and 24.4% for the elderly of ages 65 and older,
where as the United State&#146;s are 22.9%, 11.8%, and 15.7%

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><B>PAST GROWTH RATES
FOR THE COUNTES OF FOCUS</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Arkansas&#146;
population increased 7.7 percent between 1960 and 1970, and the state
increased 10.0 percent between 1970 and 1975 (<I>Monroe/Arkansas
Department of Local Services</I>, 1977).  However, not all the
counties we focused on contributed to the state&#146;s growth. 
Faulkner, Lonoke, Pulaski, and Saline increased in population, but
Monroe and Prairie had a decrease in growth.  The decrease or
increase of population was due natural increase&#151;more births over
deaths&#151;and by migration.  All the statistics that are discussed
can be seen in Tables ?-?.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Faulkner County
experienced an increase of 8.9 percent between 1960 and 1970 and an

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Lonoke County
experienced a moderate increase of 6.9 percent during 1960 and 1970
(<I>Lonoke/Arkansas Department of Local Services</I>, 1977).  It
continued to increase the next five years by 17.7 percent to 30,900
population.  The Arkansas Department of Local Services contributed
the majority of its growth to migration (1977).  The out-migration
was -4.0 between 1960 and 1970, and the in-migration became more
important between 1970 and 1974 with a rate of 13.6 percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Pulaski and Saline
County were two of Arkansas&#146; fastest growing counties. 
Pulaski&#146;s total population increased 18.2 percent between 1960
and 1970, and it increased by 12.9 percent during the next five years
to a population of 324,200 (<I>Pulaski/Arkansas Department of Local
Services</I>, 1977).  Pulaski&#146;s growth was many due to natural
increase.  Migration also played a role to the increase, and the
Arkansas Department of Local Services said that between 1960 and
1970, the in-migration rate was 2.8 percent.  This rate continued to
increase through 1975 by 6.7 percent.  Saline County&#146;s total
population increase was even higher that Pulaski&#146;s.  Saline
increased by 24.7 percent between 1960 and 1970 and by 19.2 percent
between 1970 and 1975 to a population of 43,000.  However, unlike
Pulaski, most of Saline&#146;s growth was due to migration.  Between
1960 and 1970, Saline&#146;s in-migration rate was 12.7 percent.  It
was even higher between 1970 and 1975 with a rate of 15.0 percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Unlike the previous
counties mentioned, Monroe County&#146;s population decreased.  The
population decreased by 9.6 percent between 1960 and 1970
(<I>Monroe/Arkansas Department of Local Services</I>,1977).  The
county continued to decrease the next five years by 2.7 percent to a
population of 15,200.  The Arkansas Department of Local Services
suggested that the decrease was due to the out-migration rate being
21.9 percent (1977).  However, during 1970 and 1975 the out-migration
became less important to the decrease with a rate of 5.1 percent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Prairie County also
experienced a population decrease.  Between 1960 and 1970, the total
population decreased 2.5 percent.  By 1975, the county decreased even
further with a rate of 3.1 percent to a population of 9,900.  Much of
the county&#146;s population lost was due to migration.  The
out-migration rate between 1960 and 1970 was 9.8 percent, and the
rate was 4.8 percent during 1970 and 1975.</P>
<H1><FONT SIZE=3>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN ARKANSAS</FONT></H1>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">Over
the last two years, Arkansas has experienced significant job loss
from plant closings in the apparel
industries(http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/fcast/apr98.htlm). The
manufacturing employment of goods in Arkansas is stabilizing due from
strong demand for parts and consumer goods. With Arkansas&#146;s
comparatively low corporate tax burden and progressive tax
incentives, the state has managed to maintain its economic growth and
development. Arkansas attracts companies looking to locate or expand
due to it&#146;s geographical location, efficient transportation to
important markets, excellent labor relations, a strong
infrastructure, services for established industries, quality of life
and the diverse landscape and natural resources
(http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/fcast/apr98.htlm).</P>
<H2>ECONOMIC FORECAST SUMMATION IN ARKANSAS</H2>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">Research
has shown that the state&#146;s manufacturing base and economy should
continue to grow and benefit from a fundamentally sound domestic U.S.
economy. The restrictions on a tight labor market should lessen due
to the low cost of capital and retail trade should hold steady on a
moderate growth trend. The state&#146;s employed residents should see
total wage and salary income gains during 1998 and exceed the
previous two years. However, the Arkansas outlook remains somewhat
cautious for 1999.  This outlook is due to such factors as serious
problems with the Asian economics, the Y2K computer problem which
could pose a mixed economic impact picture for the state, personal
income fluctuating between 4.5% and 5.5%, and wage gains slowing
slightly due to a higher employment growth and a continuation of the
tight labor market. Inflation will move up slightly from unusually
low levels to about 3% and the state revenue collections should
remain stable for the next three years. In order for the state&#146;s
economy to continue to reflect growth, there has to be a continuous
commitment to increase concessions to companies that have ongoing
high wage, high-skill jobs to expand and locate in Arkansas

<H2>CONCLUSION</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	The question, &#147;Will
the south rise again?&#148; was proposed in the introduction.  Well,
as far as the state of Arkansas is concerned it will&#151;just not by
tomorrow.  Arkansas&#146; growth may not be rapid or Phoenix-like,
however it is at a steady pace.  The areas which we determined best
illustrated growth are the state&#146;s population and economy. 
Arkansas&#146; population grew 7.3 percent between 1990 and 1997. 
The best determiner of a region&#146;s economic growth has to be in
its individual per capita growth and ability to bring in new
businesses, to create further economic growth.  In both of these
categories, Arkansas has grown right at or slightly above the
national average.  In fact, according to <I>Survey of Current
Business</I>, Arkansas, as a state, has placed in the top quarter for
individual per capita growth since third quarter of 1997 (Survey of
Current Business).  As for the six Central Arkansas counties we
focused on, Faulkner, Lonoke, Monroe, Praire, Pulaski and Saline,
their growth have been overall constant but not that impressive. 
This is because the counties are so diverse.  For instance, Pulaski
County has a population of 349,660 with an individual per capita of
$22,356, while Monroe County with a population of 60,006 and an
individual per capita of $13,440.  So will the South rise again? 
Right now, no&#151;but, with Arkansas&#146; steadily increasing
growth rate, it may be on its way.
