simple definition can describe the numerous religions in the world.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Religion is a system of beliefs regarding
conduct in accordance with teachings found in sacred writings or declared by
authoritative teachers (Bergman 1999: 258).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>For many people, religion is an organized system of beliefs, ceremonies,
practices, and worship that center on one supreme god, or deity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For many others, religion involves a number
of gods, or deities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some people have a
religion in which no specific god or gods are worshiped.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Almost all people who follow some form of
religion believe that a divine power created the world and influences their
lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>People
practice religion for several reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Many people throughout the world follow religion simply because it is
part of the heritage of their culture, tribe, or family.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Religion gives many people a feeling of
security because they believe that a divine power watches over them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These people often ask the power for help or
protection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Numerous people follow a
religion because it promises them salvation and either happiness or the chance
to improve themselves in a life after death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>For many people, religion brings a sense of individual fulfillment and
gives meaning to life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition,
religion provides answers to such questions as What is the purpose of
life?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What is the final destiny of a
person?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What is right and wrong?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>and What are one's obligations to other
people?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, many people follow a
religion to enjoy a sense of kinship with their fellow believers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are thousands of religions in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The eight major ones, in the order of their founding, are Judaism,
Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shinto, Christianity, and Islam
(Verkamp, 61).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hinduism, Taoism, and
Shinto developed over many centuries and cannot be traced to personal
founders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other religions
traditionally base its faith on the life or teaching of specific
individuals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are Abraham and Moses
for Judaism; Prince Siddhartha Gautama, who became known as Gautama Buddha, for
Buddhism; Confucius for Confucianism, Jesus Christ for Christianity; and
Muhammad for Islam (Verkamp, 74).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
religions that trace their history to individuals follow a general pattern of
development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During the individual's
lifetime or soon after his death, a distinctive system of worship ceremonies
grew up around him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This system, called
a cult, became the basis of the religion (Crosby, 15).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The heart of the cult is the individual's
teachings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition to inspiring
worship, the individual represents an ideal way of life that followers try to
imitate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
eight major religious practices in the world today were either founded or
developed their basic form between about 600 B.C. and A.D. 600.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Although all of the eight different
religions are found in some form in Arkansas, Christianity is the religion of
the majority of Arkansans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Christianity,
an offshoot of Judaism, is based on the life and teachings of Jesus, a Jewish
preacher of the first century A.D. whom his followers believed was the messiah
promised by God (Getis 1998: 262).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and was sent to earth to
be the Savior. His teachings was not a rejection of Judaism, but a promise of
salvation to all mankind not just a chosen people (Getis 1998, 262). The Jews
around 30 A.D crucified Jesus. After Jesus' Crucifixion, a number of his
followers spread his teachings throughout the mid-East.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the most important of these followers
was Saint Paul who preached in many large cities in the eastern Mediterranean
such as Rome and Jerusalem. His many letters to early Christian groups make up
some of the New Testament (Getis 1998: 263).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>On these visits and in his letters Paul stressed that proselytizing is a
duty of a Christian. The idea that it was the duty of a Christian to “spread
the word of God” helped Christianity grow. The spatial diffusion of
Christianity was greatly aided by the Roman Empire’s extensive system of roads
and sea lanes that covered most of Europe, the Middle East and northern Africa.
The early diffusion of Christianity follows these transportation routes. The
Christian church of Egypt was founded in Alexandria in 41 A.D., and
Christianity diffused south into today’s Ethiopia by the fourth century.
Christian churches were founded in India as early as the second century. To the
northeast Armenia became the first Christian nation early in the fourth century
(Bergman 1999: 263). In the early 300's, the Roman emperor Constantine the
Great became a Christian and favored the spread of Christianity throughout the
empire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the late 300's, Christianity
was widely practiced throughout the empire. Under the rule of the Roman Empire,
the church adopted a geographical organization; the priests of the villages
were under the rule of the bishops of the cities who were under the rule of the
Pope. One reason it took almost 400 years for Christianity to spread throughout
the Roman Empire was the friction of distance. It was very expensive and, until
the emperor approved of Christianity, very dangerous to travel and spread the
teachings of Christ. Also this was before Gutenberg’s movable type printing
press so it very expensive to reproduce copies of the Bible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>During the Middle Ages, Christian
missionaries converted many European barbarian tribes, which led to the
Christian church's dominant influence on European life for centuries.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For many years, a split had been developing
between Christians in Western Europe and those in Eastern Europe and western
Asia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The spilt finally occurred in the
1000's.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The churches in Greece, Russia,
and other parts of Eastern Europe and western Asia became known as the Eastern
Orthodox Churches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The church in
Western Europe became known as the Roman Catholic Church.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the 1500's a religious movement called the Protestant Reformation divided
western Christianity into several bodies. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Most southern Europeans remained Roman Catholics.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A great number of northern Europeans, known
as Protestants, formed new churches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The largest included the Baptists, Congregationalists, Episcopal,
Lutheran, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
Europeans began settling North America in the 16th century they brought
Christianity with them. The early explorers motto was “Gold, God and Glory”
(Cossman 2000: lecture). This desire for converts was aided by the printing
press that made it easier and cheaper to spread copies of the Bible. The lack
of roads and language barriers made converting the natives harder. The early
explorers often forced the natives to convert giving then the choice the
convert or die. Because the Catholic Spanish conquered Central and South
America it is today mainly Catholic. The Protestant English were the major
settlers of present day USA and Canada and therefore the countries are mainly
Protestant. It took much less time for Christianity to diffuse across America
that it did Europe. One reason is because by the time the Europeans settled the
Americas Christianity was an established religion that they brought over with
them. With each town established one off the first buildings built was a church
so as Europeans spread across America so did Christianity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Within
Christianity, a movement called charismatic Christianity has attracted million
of followers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The movement began with
the founding of Pentecostalism in the United States in 1901.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pentecostalism is a highly emotional form of
religious worship and behavior that emphasizes praying.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Christian fundamentalism is a conservative
religious movement that has had great social and political influence in the
United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Christianity
fundamentalist leaders include such television evangelists as Billy Graham and
Pat Robertson.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span

predominate forms of religion in the United States we will now move on to the
background of religion in Arkansas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:2'>                        </span>Christianity
was introduced to Indians living in Arkansas thought the European explorers.
Most of the explorers arriving in Arkansas brought Christianity with them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Despite effort put forth by missionaries
over the years to convert Indians to Christianity, the Quapaws remained loyal
to their beliefs and way of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Protestants were able to convert some of the Cherokees of the area
because of their willing to adapt to the Anglo-American ways.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When the Indians were ultimately forced out
of Arkansas they took their beliefs with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
1541 Hermando De Soto tried to convert the remaining Indians to Catholicism but
ultimately was unsuccessful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1663,
131 years later, Father Marquette and Louis Joliet set out to determine if
there was a water route to the Pacific in the New World.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Upon arrival in Arkansas they were able to
gain the trust of the Quapaws due to a calumet, or peace pipe that was sacred
to the Indians, given to them by the Illinois Indians upstream (McKnight 1955:
41).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Indians became interested in
their beliefs of the French Catholic Church and welcomed their teachings. A
cross symbolizing the French Catholic Church was planted in Arkansas claiming
the land for France in 1682 by La Salle and Hernri de Tonti.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1686 De Tonti established the first white
settlement, The Arkansas Post. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Father
Allouey was the first priest at the Arkansas Post, which was granted land for
the Catholic Church by De Tonti.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>As a
center for trade, the Arkansas Post attracted many traders, trappers, and
priest eager to preach to the Indians. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Spain
took control in 1762 to avoid allowing the English to gain control after the
French and Indian War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Focusing now on
the white settlers in Arkansas rather than the Indians, Spain had a commitment
in furthering Christianity and specifically Catholicism.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1778, several Protestant Anglo American
families moved to Arkansas Posts and were required to convert to
Catholicism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This continued until King
Carlos allowed them to practice their beliefs in private.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1811, the first Protestant sermon took
place at the Arkansas Post by John Carnahan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>As migrants increased throughout Arkansas other Christian denominations
soon spread. William Stevenson established a few Methodist societies along the
Red River in 1814.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He became a circuit
rider and others soon followed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The circuit
rider created congregations on settlements and recruited local farmers as
preachers. In addition to the Methodists, the Missouri Bethel Baptist
Association sent Reverend James Phillip Edwards to organize a Baptist Church,
near Little Rock, in 1817 (Tucker 1985: 14-15).<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Through
diffusion different types of Christianity have spread throughout Arkansas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Arkansas, which started with Native American
Shamanism, now has various forms of Christianity present.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Today Baptist and Methodist are the dominant
forms of religions practiced in Arkansas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt;mso-hyphenate:none'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
technology advances the friction of distance decreases. With the advent of cars
and paved roads it is easier and faster to move around the state and as a
result it is easier to move people and ideas. Early in the state’s history when
it was difficult to travel only the main denominations of Christianity
(Catholic, Methodist, and Baptist) were practiced but now because it is easier
to bring fringe groups together smaller, newer denominations are represented in
the state. With the advent of the Internet it is now possible to instantly gain
access to almost any kind of religion so you can practice a religion even if
there is not a physical church in the state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
