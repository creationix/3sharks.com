<P ALIGN="CENTER">Why is Arkansas the Natural State?</P>
<P>&#9;Arkansas is not always known for being the Natural State but more for being second to Mississippi in backwoods country folk.  And for good reason too, if other states had the beautiful Mountains and Rivers that Arkansas has running throughout the state they would spend more time in backwoods too.  So why is Arkansas the Natural State?  </P>
<P>In Arkansas two completely different land types run in to each other.  They are the flat lands of the Gulf Coastal Plain and the mountains of the Interior Highlands.  This severe difference makes for endless possibilities of outdoor-recreational activities that are suited for the Natural State.  Some activities include hunting and fishing in the Arkansas River Valley area, or rock climbing at Sam’s Throne, hiking, mountain biking, or backpacking in the Ozark and Ouchita Mountains.</P>
<P>Arkansas is divided into almost two equal parts the Interior Highlands and the Gulf Coastal Plain.  These two areas divide the state into almost two perfect sections.  This division line runs diagonally through the state.  The line runs from the northeast corner to the southwest corner.  </P>
<P>The northwestern part of the state is known as the Interior Highlands.  This part is mostly a mountainous area that is raised to an elevation of 2,800.  This area includes the Ozark and Ouchita Mountains and the Arkansas River Valley.  When the Interior Highlands were first formed they where plateaus that were create by the folding and uplifting of the platelets that were later washed away by the Mississippi River.  This created the ruggedness of the Ozark Mountains.  The Mississippi River did not run as strongly through the Ouchita Mountains, which are still mostly plateaus.   The ruggedness of the Ozark Mountains enables them to offer some of the best places in the state for outdoor activities and has one of the best trails in the Untied States, the Ozark Highland trail.  These mountains are some of the longest in the Untied States.  They run from the Black Hills of South Dakota to the Cumberland of Tennessee.  &quot;The Interior Highlands were formed by a violent process.  Uplifting, folding and faulting are all evident in the Highlands.&quot;(Crow, 1974:11)</P>
<P>The Gulf Coastal Plain is in the more southern part of the state.  It is part of a belt of flat land that runs from Texas to Georgia.  In the geological period (The Cretaceous) this part of Arkansas was all under water from the Gulf of Mexico.  During this period of the earth’s history less water was in the polar ice caps, making the ocean levels rise.  Because of this the Gulf Coastal Plain is now mostly flat with a few rolling hills. (Crow, 1974:11,12)</P>
<P>The Wilderness Act of 1964 was established to help protect areas uncivilized by man.  This act has enabled Arkansas to protect and keep its wilderness areas wild.  &quot;The state’s nationally-designated wilderness areas are rugged and physically challenging, usually with no established trails.  However, these make excellent hiking areas for [whom] wish to choose their own path.&quot; (Ark. Dept., 2000:58)  In the Ozark Mountains alone the wilderness areas have 65,826 acres.  These areas are open to the public across the state for recreational activities. (Forest, 2000)</P>
<P>&quot;Arkansas has over two hundred and fifty hiking trails through the state’s Corp. of Engineers recreation areas, National Forest areas, National Parks, and State Parks.&quot;(Ark. Dept.2000: 60)  They range anywhere from small day hike like the one and three fourths mile trail at Crowley’s Ridge State Park to trails that would take a month of more to complete like the Ozarks Highlands Trail that runs for one hundred and sixty five miles. (Arkansas 2000:) In the Ozark-St. Francis National Forest alone there is around three hundred miles of trails for hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, or driving all terrain vehicles.  There is also four hundred and five miles of foot trails for those who don’t mind walking. (Forest, 2000)  These three hundred miles of trails include the Moccasin Gap Horse Trails, The Huckberry Mountain Horse Trail, and Mill Creek Trail.  For people interested in off road driving there are 2,600 miles of trails in the Ozark National Forrest, and if that is not enough there is the Arkansas Back Country Driving Trails Guide that maps out just about every trail in the Ouachita and Ozark Mountains.</P>
<P>The Ozark-St. Francis National Forests is full of such trails as the King Bluff, Pedestal and the Ozark Highlands trail.  At Lake Fort Smith State Park near the Oklahoma boarder is where the Ozark Highlands trail starts and ends at the Buffalo National River in northern Arkansas.  &quot;This trail has already become one of the most important trails in the Midwest.&quot; (Forest, 2000)  Jim Henley a Boy Scout leader and outdoorsman hiked the whole trail with two others; it took them three weeks hiking over ten miles a day.  The hundred and sixty five miles of the Ozark Highlands will be more the enough most people.</P>
<P>Arkansas is not known for having some of the world’s best rock climbing, but it does have a few places where some serious climbing can be done.  One of the places to rock climb in Arkansas is Sam’ Throne.  It is a perfect place for beginners.  There are many different routs to climb in and around the area of Sam’s Throne. </P>
<P>Arkansas is full of caves where it is possible for some good caving or spelunking (cave exploration) can be done.  Blanchard Springs Caverns give guided tours everyday.  If that is not enough Little Rock Alive Outside gives guided tours for all kinds outdoors recreational activities.  I don’t suggest doing any spelunking without someone who knows what they are doing.  What seems like it fun and safe can become real dangerous very quickly.  I almost lost two of my good friends earlier this year when we were doing some amateur spelunking they came close to meeting death.</P>
<P>Some of the best places in Arkansas to canoe or kayak are all in the northwest part of the state, the Buffalo River, Big Piney Creek, Mulberry River, Illinois, and White River.  &quot;Alone the way [of the Buffalo] descends nearly 2,000 feet through layers of sandstone, limestone, and chert.  One immediately obvious result is bluffs and more bluffs-the highest in all the Ozarks.  Hidden away ready for discovery are other geologic marvels-springs, caves, waterfalls natural bridges, and box like canyons.&quot;(Great, 2000)  No matter what the seasons there is a place to canoe or kayak in Arkansas.  The White River and the lower parts of the Mulberry and most of the Buffalo are open all year round.  The others are open to float usually in the spring and fall but it all really depends on how much rain. (Forest, 2000)</P>
<P>In the mid 1900’s a group of Arkansans had the idea to purchase a large piece of land in Faulkner County at the time known as Palaram Creek.  They wanted the land badly to have a quality lake for fishing.  Some landowners didn’t want to sell their land but thanks to the Arkansas Supreme Courts and Amendment thirty-five the land was sold.  Many more land deals were made thanks to Amendment thirty-five, it gives the courts the power to set a reasonable amount for land.  </P>
<P>One of these areas purchased for developing lakes was in Conway.  Lake Conway was created in just a few years and it takes up 6,700 acres.  At its final completion it cost roughly 160,000 dollars, which was extremely cheap for such a large area.  It was over ten times the size of any other in the nation. (Holder, 24)</P>
<P> Over thirty lakes were developed in Arkansas and the majority were very large lakes.  After Lake Conway was finished in 1948 the very next year Lake Hindsville was created.  Almost every year after another lake was made for the use of hunting, fishing, and other recreational sports only.  Arkansas voted rivers and streams as the best for fishing in Arkansas closely followed by receivers and lakes.  Lake Millwood in the South West part of the state is suggested to contain some of the best bass fishing in the southern area.  Also in the survey largemouth bass are the number on preference for type to catch.</P>
<P>Revenue from hunting and fishing is a large part of Arkansas economy.  The license revenue alone for Arkansas is an estimated 8,154,719 dollars.  Arkansas does not just use the forests and waters of Arkansas for recreation but also for a living.  Over nine million a year are related to hunting and fishing purchase.  Retail in Arkansas is worth two hundred and eight million dollars a year.  Which includes all clothing and sports necessities.  With such a large profit to be made we needed some kind of organization to watch over and regulate game and fish in Arkansas.  Then on March 11, 1975 the Arkansas General Assembly voted to establish the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.</P>
<P>The Potlatch Lands were one of the most recent additions to the state great hunting and fishing areas.  Over 41,000 acres were made into a national wildlife refuge.  This area is in Monroe and in a few other surrounding Arkansas counties.  The land and water was added to the White River region.  The waters contain large amounts of Bream, Crappie, Catfish, and Bass.  This area is also home to some of America’s best winter duck hunting.  The land came with a few more laws than normal to ensure that all could use it.  Now new hunting structures are allowed to be built and all hunters must carry a copy of regulations for the Potlatch hunting and fishing grounds. (Heller, 1984:19)</P>
<P>Hunting in Arkansas has always been popular throughout the years.  At one time in Arkansas history commercial hunters and fishermen came from around the world to hunt many animals to near extinction if not killing all.  Buffalo, which was once in the state, are all gone.  In the 1900’s once our motto was &quot;Bear State&quot; and for period of time we didn’t live up to the name.  Many larger game hunters came and killed off a large population of these bears.  The Game and Fish Commission stocked two hundred and fifty four bears in the Ozarks.  Today the black bear population is up to around 3,000.  </P>
<P>Due to destruction of habitats and extensive hunting deer were at a downfall in population.  Then in 1964 Arkansas had a rebirth of deer.  Thanks to Game and Fish the illegal hunting of deer was put at almost a standstill.  There were an estimated 32,000 deer in the woods in 1946.  The abundance of deer makes Arkansas a hunter’s paradise.  The most plentiful game in the nation is also very large in Arkansas, the white tail deer.  The reason for them to thrive here is because of the reduction in number of predators has reduced over the past few decades.  The best deer hunting run’s across the Southern part of the Mississippi River.  By 1994 with the help of good sportsmanship and the Game and Fish Commission the Arkansas deer heard had surpassed the million markers. (<U>Arkansas Wildlife</U> 1994)</P>
<P>Arkansas woods and waters create a mini Colorado within the state for all Arkansas to enjoy.  Recreational activities are provided thanks to nature and sportsmen all over the state.  Amendment thirty-five and others laws and regulations have helped immensely to create areas all over the state for people to enjoy our resources. </P>
