<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">What are the Major Causes of Death in Arkansas?</P>

<P>&#9;</B>Death is a phenomenon that will affect every person in his or her lifetime.  All people can relate to this subject, whether it be through the loss of a loved one, the leading news story for the day, or the movie we watched last night.  Ultimately, we will all experience death.  In our country, thousands of people die each day to a multitude of causes.   Heart diseases, cancers, cerebrovascular diseases, accidents (motor vehicle and other), and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases are presently the leading causes of death respectively(Mortality Statistics 511-524). </P>

<B><P>&#9;</B>Heart disease is the leading cause of death within the state of Arkansas, as well as in the United States.  The national mortality rates for CHD were highest in Arkansas.  In 1998, the total number of recorded deaths in Arkansas related to diseases of the heart was 8,431.  Of those deaths, 4,175 were males and 4,256 were females.  With only a margin of roughly 125 deaths, heart disease is the number one cause of death in both genders. More women die from sudden CHD, because women have heart attacks at older ages than men.  Therefore, they are more likely to die from the attack (American Heart, 2000). If we look at numbers in relation to race, the difference is much greater.  White males accounted for 3,625 of the recorded deaths leaving the remaining 548 male deaths classified as nonwhite.  White females followed closely with the males recording 3,622 deaths, and the nonwhite females had only 631 deaths related to heart disease. If we look to age as an indicator, the chart listed below may help.  It is evident that in nonwhite races, both the males and females have lower rates of heart disease throughout their entire life spans.  These figures, as well as others, are shown in the chart below (Mortality Statistics, 511-524).</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;Some types of heart disease are linked to diet and lifestyle choices.  Smoking, eating high fat foods, and obesity contribute to the risk of heart disease.  However, others are due to genetic inheritance, infections, or other diseases.  People are sometimes born with a heart defect, others acquire it throughout their lifetime.  Heart disease related deaths increase throughout life from the age of 25.  In the U.S., two out of every five people will die because of heart disease.  Every 29 seconds a person will suffer a coronary event, and every minute someone will die from that event (American Heart Association, 2000).</P>
<P>  &#9;Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and Arkansas. It claims more than 1500 lives per day in the United States.  Cancer occurs when abnormal cells continue to divide, thus producing more cells that are dangerous. This leads to an abundance of unneeded cells, and tumor is likely to form. These tumors can damage nearby cells and organs, or pieces of the tumor can break off and enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system.  This can cause more tumors to develop in other parts of the body (American Cancer Society, 2000).</P>
<P>&#9;Cancer, also known as malignant neoplasm, accounted for 5,950 Arkansas deaths in 1998.  Males accounted for 3,256 deaths and females accounted for 2,694 deaths.  Looking at race, again we see a wide difference.  Death due to cancer in white males was 2,810, and 2,337 in white females.  In nonwhite races, there were 444 male deaths and 356 female deaths </P>
<P>due to cancer.  If we look again to our graph below, we can see how age plays its part in this</P>

<P>&#9;The third leading cause of death in Arkansas in 1998 was cerebrovascular disease, the </P>

<P>most common neurological disorder.  . In the United States, approximately 160,000 people die </P>

<P>from it each year. It is also one of the leading causes of disability. It is actually a generic name </P>

<P>that includes many disorders caused by vascular disease of the brain, but the most common of </P>

<P>these is stroke. There are two major outcomes of cerebral vascular disease: an infarction </P>

<P>(softening of brain tissue secondary to a failure of circulation) or a hemorrhage (a blood clot that </P>

<P>forms in the brain because of the rupture of a blood vessel or a congenital vascular anomaly). </P>

<P>The risk factors associated with the disease are age, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and </P>

<P>hypercholesterolemia. Many times, heart disease accompanies cerebral vascular disease </P>

<P>(American Stroke Association, 2000).</P>
<P>The total number of cerebrovascular disease related deaths in Arkansas were 2,344, with 901 being males and 1,443 being females.  Of the 901 males, 735 were white and 166 were nonwhite.  The 1,443 female deaths were comprised of 1,189 white and 251 nonwhite.  The chart below lists different factors as associated with age (Mortality Statistics, 511-524).</P>

<P>&#9;The fourth leading cause of death in Arkansas in 1998 was accidents.  Within this </P>

<P>category, there are two subcategories.  Motor vehicle accidents and miscellaneous accidents </P>

<P>resulting in death make up the two subcategories.  Total deaths due to accidents were 1,296.  Of </P>

<P>&#9;The fifth leading cause of death in Arkansas in 1998 was chronic obstructive </P>
<P>pulmonary disease.  COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, responsible for over 100,000 deaths per year. The term refers to lung problems brought on by other conditions, usually emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Both conditions restrict the lungs from transferring enough oxygen to the body or exhaling carbon dioxide. There are different causes that lead to the same overall effect. In chronic bronchitis, the lungs become inflamed and cause the overproduction of mucus, which makes it difficult to breath. Because of the added mucus, the lungs are more prone to become infected. In the case of emphysema, the alveoli (air sacs at the end of the bronchioles) lose elasticity, which causes oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange to become difficult. Because it is hard to exhale, stale air gets trapped in the lungs, thus making it even harder to take in a full fresh breath. Of the sufferers of COPD, 80% - 90% are cigarette smokers (On Health, 2000).  This disease accounted for a total of 1,236 deaths in Arkansas; 654 were male and 582 were female.  The white male deaths totaled 587, and nonwhite deaths totaled 63. The white females closely followed 554 deaths.  The nonwhite females had only 25 related deaths.( Mortality Statistics, 511-524)</P>

<P>In order to maintain a systematic outlook on the Arkansas population’s health statistics, the state is divided into Health Management Areas. &#9;Area #1, known as the Ozarks, had the highest death rate in Arkansas.  This area has a great deal of industrialization and wealth.  Of course, stress and pollution often accompany industrialization and wealth.  Of the 27,452 deaths in Arkansas in 1998, a total of 4,829 occurred in Area #1.  Area #7, known as the delta, ranked last with only 1,249 deaths.  This area is comprised of mostly farmers and farmland.  This area is comparatively poorer than Area #1, as well as other parts of the state.  Area #1, in the northwest region of the state, has the highest death rate in all of the top five causes of death in Arkansas.  Area #7 holds the lowest figures for these and many other causes of death.  Faulkner County is located in Area #3, which is ranked seventh, had a total of 2,248 deaths in 1998.  Deaths in relation to Health Management Areas, causes, sex, race, and counties are also listed in the charts below (Mortality Statistics, 511-524).</P>

<P>Principle causes of death have changed over the last 50 years.  In 1948, the top five causes of death differed little from those of 1998.  Heart disease was the number one killer.  Cancer and cerebrovascular disease, also known as intercranial lesions of vascular origin, were second and third on the list.  Accidents were the fourth leading cause of death in Arkansas in 1948.  The fifth leading cause of death was nephritis.  Pneumonia, tuberculosis, and prematurity were other top causes of death. (1948 Annual Report, 3) It seems we still battle heart disease, cancer, and cerebrovascular disease.  Accidents still take many lives.  However, due to immunizations, technology, and education we can reduce many of the killers of yesterday.  Media and medicine cannot cure all illnesses, but they can help our society defend itself against many illnesses.</P>
<P>&#9;The main difference between the top killers of today and yesterday is choice.  Many of the killers today could be avoided more often through health care and healthy living.  Today, we are an educated society.  However, many continue to smoke, eat unhealthy foods, and become stagnant.  These factors contribute to the causes of death (Health Care, 2000).  Today, unlike 50 years ago, much of the death is degenerative.  Humans often aid in their own illnesses.  In 1948, most people did not know the extensive damage that could be done by cigarettes.  They also did not know the proper diet to follow.  People were also somewhat ignorant to the effects of pollution, stress, and other toxins to the body.  Some still remain uneducated about health care and do not think it is necessary until it is too late.  Also, even though we have the technology, some people are still denied health care based on economic issues.   It could be argued that one of the leading causes of death in human beings is human beings.</P>
