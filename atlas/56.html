few earthquakes. These areas are known as seismic zones. The long, narrow

interior and surface. In addition, there are three basic types of seismic
waves. The primary waves, known as P waves, spread in the crust from the point
of rupture, which is called the focus of the earthquake. The point on the
Earth's surface immediately above the focus is termed the epicenter of an
earthquake. P waves alternately compress and expand the rock through which they
pass and vibrate in the same direction in which the waves travel. Secondary waves,
known as S waves, vibrate at right angles to the direction of wave travel.
These secondary waves are the &quot;shake&quot; waves that move particles up
and down or from side to side. The speed of S waves is always less than that of
P waves. Finally, after both P and S waves have moved through the body of the
Earth, two types of surface waves known as L (I) and L (II) waves follow them.
Because of their larger amplitude, these L waves are responsible for much of
the destructive shaking that occurs far from the epicenter. These surface
waves, which travel more slowly than the interior waves, are the most powerful
shock waves (Walker 1992).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the surface down to a maximum depth of about 435 miles (700 kilometers). More
than 75 percent of the seismic energy produced each year, however, is released
by earthquakes with foci less than about 37 miles (60 kilometers) deep. These
are the dangerous earthquakes that pose a significant hazard to populated
regions. They are known as shallow-focus earthquakes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

measures the strength of an earthquake is called a seismograph. Chang Heng made
the first known piece of equipment designed to measure earthquakes in China in
AD 132. It depended on falling metal balls to determine the direction and size
of the quake. In 1855 an Italian physicist named Luigi Palmieri designed a set
of U-shaped glass tubes partly filled with mercury. A shaking of the ground set
the mercury in motion, making an electrical contact that stopped a clock and
set a recording drum in motion. The drum measured the motion of an iron float
on the mercury's surface (Comptons 1996).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

British scientist John Milne, who was studying earthquakes in Japan with
associates James Alfred Ewing and Thomas Gray. They organized the Seismological
Society of Japan in 1880, and the organization encouraged the invention of new
types of measuring equipment. The one invented by Milne was basically a
horizontal pendulum device, a type of seismograph that has been modified and
improved for more than a century (Comptons 1996)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

seismometer, record induced tension that passes through an electronic amplifier
to a recording galvanometer. A photographic seismic recorder scans a rapidly
moving film, making sensitive time-movement registrations. Refraction and
reflection waves are usually recorded on magnetic tapes, which are readily
adapted to computer analysis. Strain seismographs, employing electronic
measurement of the change in distance between two concrete pylons about 30
meters (100 feet) apart, can detect compressional and extensional movement in
the ground during seismic vibrations. The Benioff linear strain seismograph
detects strains related to tectonic processes, those associated with propagating
seismic waves, and tidal yielding of the solid Earth. Still more recent
inventions include rotation seismographs; tiltmeters; wide-frequency-band,
long-period seismographs; and ocean-bottom seismographs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

location, time, and strength of future earthquakes, the best results seem to be
associated with using earthquake observatories. (Chinese researchers, however,
have achieved some success using, in part, signs of animal restlessness for
forewarning.) Other methods are based on detecting gaps in the seismic record
of a region. Segments along a fault where displacement has not taken place for
a long time are more likely to release built-up stresses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%'>Seismologists have found that
major earthquakes are often preceded by certain measurable physical changes in
the environment around their epicenters. These changes include the degree of
crustal deformation in fault zones; the occurrence of dilatancy, that is, an
increase in volume, of rocks; and a rise in radon concentrations in wells.
Continual monitoring and close scrutiny of these changes are expected to
improve prediction capability. Risk maps can be prepared for some
earthquake-prone regions, as in California, where surface faults can be
monitored. Although useful in transcursion zones, such as along the San Andreas
Fault, the method is not applicable to subduction zones, where seismic
activity, generated deep in the Benioff zone, is only vaguely correlated with
surface structures (Vogt 1989).</p>
