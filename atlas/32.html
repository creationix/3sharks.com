</U><P>Could you imagine being separated from the rest of the world?  Having not a thing to do with modern society and being seen by people as "outcasts".  Arkansas is made up many cultures that are known by most people, from African American backgrounds to the French.  One culture that isn't all known about is the Amish.  Most Arkansans, if asked would tell you that they didn't know that Amish were living in the same state as them.  The reason people don't know about the Amish is because they keep to themselves and separate themselves from modern society. </P>
<P>&#9;Amish means to be, mind, body and soul like Christ. Christ and his church, and to have this relationship you must up hold a simple life style where you depend on each other.  Lastly, you must separate yourself from the " outer world".  Doing this keeps their religious beliefs in order throughout their community.</P>
<P>      The Amish came to the United States trying to find life with more economic and religious stability because they were trying to escape the horrible situation in Europe during the 19<SUP>th</SUP> Century.  After Louis XVI was executed Maximilien Robespiere took rule of France, Germany and Alsace.  Trying to keep peace Robespiere had his officials be kind to the Amish.  Years later things changed and Napoleon Bonaparte took reign.  He felt that the Amish should be treated equally as others and insisted that they participate in war.  " For the Amish, war best illustrates a sinful world in violation of God's fundamental will and purpose.  War is sin" (Amish and the State, p.44).  Since the Amish are highly against violence they fled to the Americas.  Many Amish families migrated to Canada and many settled in Pennsylvania.  When the Amish first came the United States they were apprehensive, but were welcomed by the native Americans.  Many families moved westward to find better land and weather. Some moved south down into Arkansas.    Amish Arkansans can be found around Bebe and in Dumas.  &quot; The cardinal value of the Amish society is separation from the world,&quot; (Amish and the State, p.11).  The Amish live far away from towns, highways, and/or anywhere where &quot;modern&quot; people live.  &quot; The Amish lead simple lives that shun worldly affairs and give more importance to their families and homes,&quot; (http://www.geocities).    </P>
<P>&#9;The Amish base everything that they do on the Ordnung.  The Ordnung is like a blueprint for expected behavior, and is passed orally by generation.  It tells the Amish everything they need to know to keep their lives as simple as possible.  The Ordnung defines the Amish ways such as, wearing a beard without a mustache to the dialect they use.  &quot; The Ordnung, an informal policy, regulates Amish life by selectively preserving tradition while also permitting change,&quot; (Amish and the State, p.10).  Amish children learn the Ordnung through the ways of the adults.  As young adults, they declare their faith at baptism, and promise to practice the Ordnung for the rest of their lives.  If they break their vow, they can face being excommunicated and shunned.  Unlike modern religion, the Amish doesn’t relegate to an hour of service on Sundays.  They have districts that set up the church services.  For instance, one Sunday 11 districts have church in 11 different homes, and the next Sunday the next 11 will have church.  When the districts have church on the off Sundays they usually have it in a farmhouse, or basement.  Church lasts for about two and half-hours. While they are in church everything is kept simple, the singing is sung without accompaniment, and the sermons are short and simple.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;The value structure of Amish life pivots on Gelassenheit (pronounced Ge-las-en-hite), the cornerstone of Amish values. Roughly translated, the German word means submission- yielding to a higher authority,&quot;(Amish and the State, p.12).  The religious meaning of Gelassenheit is to put the needs of others before your self.  &quot; A favorite saying the Amish have is, &quot;JOY&quot;, which means <U>J</U>esus first, <U>Y</U>ourself last, and <U>O</U>thers in between,&quot; (Amish and the State, p.13).  </P>
<P>&#9;The Amish may live and act differently than the modern world, but in some aspects they tend to have similarities.  For instance, everyone has an opinion of what is &quot;right and wrong&quot;, and they stand up for what they believe.  People are compassionate and most will do any thing for another human being. The Amish live like they preseeve Christ would and try to stick to a strict moral code that will keep them &quot;Christ-like&quot;.  In every religion there is a code that each individual lives by that keeps them holy and in tune with God.  There are some many differences between the modern world and Amish.     Culturally their values, beliefs, and convictions are different.  Socially the Amish interacts amongst them.  Children who are in preschool up to the eighth grade go to school together.  The eighth grade is the last grade for Amish children because they feel that too much knowledge is poison.   An unmarried woman usually teaches the children, and they learn basic writing, reading, and arithmetic. In public schools children K-12 are separated in different schools, and most even go on to college.  Also, public schools are integrated.  Marriages in the Amish culture are quite unusual.  &quot; They begin their search for a spouse around the age of sixteen.  When the male asks the female to marry him, he will usually give her china or a clock instead of a diamond ring.  The second Sunday after communion is when the church announces the couple’s news, then the women have only a few days to prepare for the wedding.  The bride makes her own dress and it is typically blue, and her attendants are either sky blue or shades of purple.  A full day is needed to prepare for the big day.  </P>
<P> The wedding day starts about 4 o’clock in the morning.  All the morning chores still have to be done like milk the cows and feed the chickens, and then they prepare for the wedding.  When the ceremony begins the minister says a sermon, does a blessing, and unites the couple, and all of lasts about three hours.  After the service, the feast begins.  They have a long dinner and the clean takes place.  The happy couple stays together in the bride’s home the first night.  Their honeymoon is spent at their relatives homes on the weekends, this is how they obtain their wedding gifts,&quot; (http://www.800padtch.com).  In a modern wedding, the ceremony takes place typically in a church and lasts around an hour.  The honeymoon is spent alone and maybe on a tropical beach.  Technologically, the Amish &quot;choose to examine change carefully before they accept it.  If the new gadget does not assist in keeping their lives simple and their family together, they probably will reject it,&quot; (http://www.800padutch.com).  The Amish like modern people uses the Internet to communicate.  They buy, sell, and trade with it.  The Amish sell quilts, furniture, and even recipes on the Internet, which is surprising because they are using something so complex to deal with the world locally and globally.  Modern societies use electricity and drive cars, where the Amish still uses candlelight and drive by horse and buggy.  The reason they use the horse and buggy method is because, &quot; don’t want to attract attention to themselves,&quot;(<A HREF="http://www.geocities)/"><FONT SIZE=2>http://www.geocities)</FONT></A>. In the 1950’s a law was passed that made the Amish put a reflecting triangle on the back of the buggy so others would see them driving at night.  </P>
<P>&#9;Amish dress is kept very simple and plain.  &quot;The men wear dark colored vests over white home-made shirts and they have collarless coats with hooks.  The women wear ankle length dresses with black stockings and shoes,&quot;(<A HREF="http://www.arthuril.com)/"><FONT SIZE=2>http://www.arthuril.com)</FONT></A>.  Any one from modern society typically wouldn’t wear their dress because most people wear designer clothes and shoes.  </P>
<P>&#9;Since Amish feel that war is a sin they don’t fight in wars like most Americans do.  Like other Americans Amish pay taxes. &quot; They believe that they should obey the law and pay taxes even though it violates their religion.  They pay income tax, sales tax, state tax, school tax, and personal property tax,&quot; (Amish and the State, p.127).                                        </P>
<P>     The Amish like most Americans believe in tradition and will do any thing for their family whenever they need help.  Amish are hard working people that live simple lives and who shun worldly affairs.  Personally, the Amish deserves credit for keeping their faith the same way for centuries and not letting the modern world influence their values or beliefs.  &quot;  The Amish have not adjusted to society, but society has adjusted to the Amish.  Though they do not like to draw attention to themselves, the Amish people have spread their culture and ideas and influenced many people from various backgrounds, races, and ages,&quot;(<A HREF="http://www/"><FONT SIZE=2>http://www</FONT></A>.geocities).  The Amish community helps remind society if its own ideas and beliefs, and has some what form the American society.  </P>
