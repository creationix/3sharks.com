<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">In the world&#146;s marketplace
for ideas, America is searching for a unique cultural identity, for
few things can be called uniquely ours.  We look to Paris and Milan
for our fashions.  We developed the first mass marketed car, but
German and Italian designers create better vehicles.  The microwave,
an American invention, was reverse engineered by the Japanese and now
they are the ones who sell it.  Even the atomic bomb was developed
with the help of a recent foreign emigrant, Albert Einstein.  With
that said however, this nation&#146;s greatest asset is its ability
to take diffuse ideas and mold them into something that is ours.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	The origins of the blues music
are shrouded in the mists of time, but there are some generally
accepted ideas as to where it came from and how it developed.  One
idea says that the blues were actually a form of African music that
transmitted the traditions and sufferings African slaves experienced.
 These songs covered a wide range of subjects from work to love to
spiritual music (Carney, 55).  Another idea is that the blues came
from black sharecroppers who lived together in large communities. 
These communities did not quite have the same conditions that slaves
faced, but living was pretty hard (Carney, 56).  Also, in these
communities, different African tribal groups were thrown together and
these songs were one way to communicate traditions through music to
their children.  </FONT>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">According to George Carney, the
new world instruments were unfamiliar to the slaves, but they were
able to express their tribal music through vocal chants and the
rhythmic banging of work implements (Carney, 57).  After the Civil
War, the musicians had freedom to travel where they wanted.  In order
to do this, they needed easily transportable instruments.  As a
result, early blues musicians primarily used the guitar and
harmonica.  Both of these instruments are inexpensive and easy to
carry which allowed the musicians to be fairly mobile with their
songs.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Robert Johnson, Blues man
Extraordinaire</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	In the early part of the 1900&#146;s,
the premier blues musician was a man by the name of Robert Johnson. 
While dying at the young age of 27, Robert Johnson&#146;s impact on
blues culture and the development of guitar styles has been
substantial.  An interesting point is that Johnson only recorded 29
songs, but these songs have been more closely analyzed than any other
blues composer (Blue Flame).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	Robert Johnson was born
illegitimately to Julia Dodds and Noah Johnson in 1911.  When he was
either three or four, he moved to Memphis with Julia and her husband
Charles.  In 1930, at the age of 19, he got married, but soon after
lost his wife to labor in childbirth.  It was at this point that
Johnson struck out as a wandering blues man (Blue Flame).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	What happened next is part of
the myth and legend surrounding Robert.   Apparently, Robert&#146;s
skill at playing the guitar was almost non-existent.  He was so bad
that other blues artist refused to play with him.  Then,
mysteriously, his disappeared for a brief while.  When he returned,
his skill was much greater than it should have been.  Robert often
boasted of having gone to the crossroads to make a deal with the
devil.  He had sold his soul to the devil for skill at the guitar.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	It is a little difficult to tell
where reality stops and myth begins.  The question of where his
sudden spurt of talent came from is one idea that allows the myth to
continue.  Also, Robert talked about Hellhounds being on his trail
and the fact that the Devil himself was after him.  A large part of
his music deals with this subject and good verses evil.  Most likely,
the myth was the product of jealousy of other artists and some shrewd
marketing.  The myth started when other blues musicians speculated on
where Robert&#146;s sudden talent had come from (Blue Flame). 
Probably to keep the mystique alive and to practice stuff that would
not be copied until he had an opportunity to perform it, Robert
practiced in graveyards in the middle of the night.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	The career of Robert was cut
short by the unfortunate difficulty of being caught in bed with
another man&#146;s wife.  In revenge, the jealous husband laced a
bottle of whiskey with strychnine.  Johnson died in Greenwood,
Mississippi with only a few recordings under his belt but what he
started has many lingering effects that are felt in the music scene
today.  Some of the most famous names in music look back to Robert as
their inspiration: Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, and
Richards from the Rolling Stones to name a few (Blue Flame).</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Diffusion of the Blues</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	&#147;A discerning collection of
blues records can act as vinyl stratigraphy of North America&#146;s
black population, reflection the development of a people and of how
it responded to the environmental changes that were thrust upon it
(Carney, 55).&#148; Blues music has its roots in the struggles of
African slaves who yearned for freedom and a better life.  After
emancipation, blacks were nominally free, but still tied to the land
in a sharecropping system.  In other words, the names had been
changed, but the conditions remained the same.  The process of
diffusion was quite slow at first.  Blues flowed up from the
plantations along major communication routes, such as railways and
the Mississippi river (Carney, 57).  The major reason diffusion was
slow was that the artist had to be physically present.  According to
George Lee, it took, W. C. Handy, to promote and produce the blues in
recordings, introducing the rest of America to the Blues (Lee, 132). 
W. C. Handy eventually collaborated with Harry Pace, a small town
songwriter, (Lee, 134) and started the Handy and Pace Company in
1917.  In that same year, the company moved to New York and created a
sensation on Broadway.  Perhaps Handy&#146;s greatest idea was to
have a woman front the Blues.  The style became a sensation and every
company wanted a piece of the action. Blues music, in the mainstream,
took off (Lee, 143).  Handy played major role in the diffusing the
blues, he took it from the fields and the &#147;Negro breakdowns on
Saturday night &#148; and commercialized it and brought it to rest of
the world.   </FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	&#147;If you&#146;ve ever been
mistreated &#150; then you know what I&#146;m talkin&#146; about&#133;
(Eddie Boyd, quoted in Finn, pg. 92).&#148;  The blues style is
simple with 12 repeated measures and a repeatable theme, but it
speaks to the soul.  Blues music is not always about sadness, but is
more appropriately described as life as seen through the eyes of a
man who had to struggle to survive.</FONT></P>
