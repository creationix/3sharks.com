<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As we look back
through time, it is apparent that the roles of men, women, and children have
changed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We think that these changes
have resulted mainly from a changing society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Today, unlike years ago, the man is not necessarily the &quot;head of
the household.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Women are becoming more
independent and they are sharing family responsibilities with the males.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since couples are not forced to have many
children in order to make ends meet, the wives have more time and energy to put
to use outside her family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We decided
that these changes might possibly be seen by examining tombstones in cemeteries
and graveyards around Conway and surrounding areas.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>This would be a way to see how people ultimately felt about sex
roles in their personal lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the
roles of men, women, and children have changed over time, so have their
headstones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although economic status
effects the choice of headstones, by looking at their sizes, we can determine
if there has been any role changes. To better determine the roles tombstones
play in gender roles, the historical changes of women in society must be
addressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To better determine the
roles tombstones play in gender roles, the historical changes of women in
society must be addressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Over the years,
women’s rights have progressed, but we can still see a slight difference
between men and women in everyday life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>On August 19, 1920, Congress created an amendment stating that every
American citizen has the right to vote (<a
href="http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/womrts/homepage.htm)">http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/womrts/homepage.htm</a>).
No one was to be discriminated against because of gender, no matter if that
person was male or female.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was a
big deal to the women of the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Not only did it allow women to vote, but it also made it where they
would be considered more equal in our society. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
today’s world, women are supposed to have the same rights as men, but we still
see a little difference in the behavior of men versus women in the work place,
as well as on the street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example,
if there was a job opening where a man and a woman were both applying, most
likely the man would be placed in the position simply because of how our
society looks at the roles of men versus women.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is not that the women could not do the job; it is that the
employer would rather have a man working for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another example of
how women are viewed differently in society is in the home.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The woman is looked at as being under the
man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The man is supposed to go out and
make the money, and the woman is supposed to stay home to cook and clean.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition, women are supposed to stay home
and take care of the kids.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now there
are day cares and after school programs designed so that mothers can have jobs
and not have to be at home all day with the kids.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Although there is nothing wrong with staying at home, not all
women want to do this for the rest of their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They want to get out and have a career just like their mate.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not all homes are like this, but you still
encounter some that believe this way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Women have just as much right to be out in the work force as men do, if
that is what they want to do with their lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another example is
the rights and roles of women in politics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Today, you do see more women involved in politics than there used to
be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Women are now getting
involved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, Janet Reno is
ranked among the most powerful people in the United States government.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thirty years ago, you would not see a woman
in public office or politics of any kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We have definitely seen a change in women’s roles over the past decade,
but it is evident that there are still changes to be made.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Society needs to realize that women are just
as important and can do just as much as men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>           </span>Overall, the roles of women in our society has greatly
increased over time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To prove this
idea, we visited Conway Cemetery and found this fact very apparent.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We noticed that from one hundred years ago
(the oldest grave in the cemetery) up to the present, women’s tombstones have
become increasingly larger and more elaborate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Not only have their tombstones become larger, they are also now equal to
their male counterparts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many women’s
tombstones that we saw were just as big and as equally beautiful as their
husbands’. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>However,
it was also apparent to us that in some cases, the roles of women today may
still be similar to those of years past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>One set of tombstones that we saw, for instance, was a grouping of a
man, his wife, and their son.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For this
particular example, not only was the husband’s headstone more than double the
size of his wife’s, so was their son’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This obviously led us to believe that this family still held the notion
of a dominant man and his subservient wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Perhaps this family, due to religion or tradition, still operated under
a system where the man was definitely the dominant head of the household.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another
tombstone we saw combined the names of an entire family—mother, father, and six
children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The dates of death of each
ranged from 1889 to 1993.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We speculated
that this particular tombstone was an example not of roles but of their low
economic status.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Perhaps the family was
not well off and simply found it more affordable to have a single headstone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More recent tombstones, which have both
husband and wife included on one, we believe to be more representative of a
feeling of unity and closeness than that of an economic factor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Oliver Cemetery is
located on White Water Road in Cedarville, Arkansas.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>This particular cemetery had the oldest gravesites that we
encountered, ranging from 1854 to the present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the notes that we took while there, we divided the tombstones into
five different categories, which are as follows: women, men, couples, families,
and children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The oldest woman’s
tombstone that we noted was that of Rachel Thompson.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>She was born on September 12, 1809 and died on October 8,
1872.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, instead of simply saying
her name as above stated, it said &quot;Rachel, wife of B. Thompson.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This seems to suggest that the woman cannot
just be herself, instead having to be known by who her husband was.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her grave was relatively large, measuring 12
½ in x 30 in x 2 in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her grave was also
covered with stones, as was common among older graves.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second woman’s grave that we noted was
that of Harriet Coleman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She was born
on March 19, 1826 and died on August 21, 1877.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Her stone was significantly smaller, measuring 8 in x 16 ½ in x 2
in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another woman’s grave that we saw,
was that of Mattie Bell Maxey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
grave was more recent than the following two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, it was approximately the same size, just differently
proportioned, as the previous one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She
was born on September 5, 1885 and died on February 4, 1927.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her tombstone measured 18 in x 9 in x 4 in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The oldest man’s
tombstone that we noted was that of T.J. Oliver.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>His date of birth was not recorded on the stone, but his date of
death was December 19, 1889.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His
tombstone measured 14 in x 35 in x 2 in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The other man’s tombstone that we noted was that of Allison Temple
Neal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was born on January 8, 1911, and
he died on October 28, 1937.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its size
was 40 ½ in x 29 in x 14 ½ in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also
stated on his tombstone was &quot;son of Bert and Iva Neal.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The outstanding size of this stone could
possibly be explained by the fact that he was a much loved </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>son, hence the inscription on
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other men’s graves that we
noted were combined with either women’s plots or an entire family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The oldest
tombstone of a couple that we saw was that of Nathan and Elizabeth
Shipley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The stone measured 21 in x 24
in x 2 in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mr. Shipley was born on May
27, 1827 and died on February 22, 1863.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Mrs. Shipley was born on July 21, 1831 and died on October 1, 1882.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their graves were encased by a square stone
fence, which measured 113 in x 118 in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Another couple that we saw were the Maxey’s—W.H. Maxey, the father, and
M.M. Maxey, the mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their tombstone
was significantly larger than the Shipley’s, measuring 30 in x 34 in x 7 ¾
in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>W. H. Maxey was born on May 16,
1849 and died on March 7, 1909.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>M. M.
Maxey was born on January 19, 1851 and died on July 5, 1908.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The last couple’s grave that we noted at
this particular cemetery was that of Elizabeth and W. M. T. Coatney.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This one was not combined as were the above
two—they were, however, situated next to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>What was odd about these tombstones was the fact that the wife’s
was significantly larger than the husband’s was.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Hers</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>measuring 8 in x 52 in x 8 in,
while his was only 12 in x 30 ½ in x 3 ¾ in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Although hers <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>was </i>quite
larger, it did suggest something that a previously mentioned one did—instead of
simple saying her name, it said, &quot;Elizabeth, wife of W. M. T.
Coatney.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore, although it tended
to elevate her from its size, it also debased her by referring to her as
someone’s possession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Further curious
was his tombstone, which simply stated his name and &quot;1<sup>st</sup> Ark.
Cav,&quot; and nothing more. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There were also a couple of sites in this cemetery,
which exuded the impression that a whole family was buried together.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These sites were surrounded by stone fences,
which encased several markers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In both
of the enclosed sites we observed, only one person had a marker, and it looked
as if they were fairly new—suggesting that perhaps a family member had recently
discovered that one of their kin was laid to rest there.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the markers was that of William
Lester, who lived from 1802 to 1859.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The stone surrounding his resting place and that of four unknown people
measured 139 in x 185 in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other
marker was that of David Walker Lewis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This enclosed gravesite also contained two unknown people and measured
102 in x 84 ½ in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>The children’s
tombstones that we saw were all quite elaborate and large, especially</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>compared to the infant graves we
saw at the Conway cemetery, which had nothing more than markers indicating the
site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Two of them were brother and
sister, both died at the age of one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They were William Walter Neal and Bertha Greenwood Neal.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>William was born on August 23, 1879 and died
on September 26, 1880, and Bertha was born on May 29, 1883 and died on June 25,
1884.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Both of there graves were encased
by stones, and they were both approximately the same size.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other child’s grave that we saw was that
of an eleven-year-old boy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His name was
Walter Herald Moon, and he was born on November 8, 1909, dying on November 13,
1920. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>His tombstone was diagonal (unlike
any other we had seen so far) and measured 16 ½ in x 19 in x 6 in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Morrison Cemetery
on Big Tree Road in Hobbtown, Arkansas, was another one that we </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>visited.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>At this particular cemetery, we came across many more recent
graves, while still encountering a few older ones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>The first woman’s
tombstone that we noted was that of Holly Kim Gentry.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>She was born </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>On August 12, 1953, and she died on
January 5, 1981.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her tombstone measured
29 in x 20 in x 6 in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other woman’s
tombstone was Lillian M. Hyatt’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She
was born on March 10, 1923, and she died on November 19, 1996.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On her tombstone was her picture and an
inscription, which read &quot;Loving Mother,&quot; and measured 24 in x 23 in x
6 in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even more striking about her
gravesite was that of the decorations surrounding it—there were flowers, a
bench, and two bird feeders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was
the first, and only, gravesite, which we saw with these characteristics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>The man’s
tombstone that we noted was also quite large and elaborate, measuring 42 ½</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>in x 32 in x 6 ½ in and having a
picture embossed on the front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
man’s name was Wallace Karl Wells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He
was born on May 26, 1960, and he died on July 10, 1986. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The couple’s grave that we saw was
that of Robert Allen and Edna Syneva Bonewell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Their tombstone was also quite massive, measuring 32 in x 42 in x 9
in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mr. Bonewell was born on February
8, 1927, and he died on October 27, 1992.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Mrs. Bonewell was born on November 2, 1928, and she is still currently
living. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We also saw a family site, which the members were
buried side by side to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
was interesting because each grave was covered with one large stone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The father’s name was Harry Lewis Sr.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was born in 1790 and died in 1860.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The mother’s name was Jane Ann Lewis, and
she lived from 1810 to 1895.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The two
children were Margaret Lewis (1842 to 1854) and an infant whose tombstone said
nothing more than that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From our
observations at this cemetery, we can see that tombstones gradually became
increasingly elaborate as the years went by. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another modern
cemetery that we went to is Olive Hill Cemetery, which is located in </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Conway, Arkansas, in a residential
area, which is predominantly occupied with affluent, retired people.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We use the adjective &quot;modern&quot; to
describe it because of the dates on the tombstones and the style of the grave
markers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of the grave markers were
not the traditional square or rectangular tombstones, but instead, were figures
of angels, tall monuments, or plaques on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The tombstones that were there, mostly those of men, also had the
old-fashioned foot markers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The dates
on these tombstones ranged from 1950 to 1960. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There was also a
cremation site here, which was the only one that we encountered out of all the
cemeteries we visited.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This consisted
of a wall of names containing birth and death dates.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Only a handful of people were listed, three of them being babies,
and all of their dates of death were in the last seven years.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This cemetery, like the Oliver Cemetery in
Cedarville, had good-sized tombstones for babies. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We noticed that, for the most part, women and
children had grave markers, whereas men had nice-sized monuments.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We also noticed that while the women and
children’s tombstones had quotes on them, the men’s had their lifetime
achievements listed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of which,
ended with &quot;devout son, father, or husband.”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>All of these suggested that men are still held far above women
and children in our society today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
further noticed that this particular cemetery had no &quot;couple&quot; tombstones.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, the husband and wife were just
buried next to each other with separate tombstones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In the past,
monuments were less elaborate and personal as they are today.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They were small, narrow monuments that were
hand carved out of stone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many resembled
mere rocks on the ground with nearly illegible carvings on them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We first thought that double monuments were
fairly new to the monument market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, Eddie Parker of Camden Monument Company (<a
href="..\Originals\tombstones%20and%20changing%20sex%20roles\www.camdenmemorials.com\location.html">www.camdenmemorials.com/location.html</a>),
said that double monuments have been around for a while.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In some of the older cemeteries we looked
at, there are some tall, narrow monuments with two names on them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those covered two grave plots and were the
old-time double monuments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Today, many
corners have been cut while making headstones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Instead of being hand made, they are now produced by machines.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This factory-style production allows for
quicker and cheaper production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Monuments have gotten larger and more personalized over the years.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The personalization involves elaborate
etchings and magnificent portraits on the headstones that add up to six hundred
dollars to the cost of the headstone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The actual prices
do vary according to size, material, color, and degree of personalization.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On average, most stones are three inches
thick and about three feet tall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
types of materials available are granite and marble.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The granite headstones are the most popular around here compared
to the marble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The colors that are used
are light gray, dark gray, blue, rose, brown, red, and black.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The light colored stones are the cheapest
and as the stones get darker, they become more expensive.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The single upright monument, at the base
price, is roughly four hundred to five hundred dollars.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With changes in stone or color, the price
can be up to one thousand dollars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
double headstones for couples start at seven hundred to eight hundred dollars.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If all things are equal on the double
headstones, then the all-around price is cheaper than buying two single
headstones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So, clearly many choose
this option because of its economic worth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Family headstones are as large or larger than the double monuments.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They usually cover four gravesites but can
also cover up to ten sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each person
buried has a small, individualized marker at the foot of his or her plot, along
with the family monument.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These prices
start at one thousand dollars— all depending on the number of plots that it
will cover. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In conclusion, by
visiting several cemeteries and observing the characteristics of many different
tombstones from various periods, we were able to establish that the roles of
men, women, and children <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>have</i> changed
over time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We concluded that, for the
most part, the roles of women have become more prominent, while men’s roles
have decreased, or perhaps stayed the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This was seen by the fact that women’s tombstones have become larger and
more elaborate over time, while men’s tombstones have not changed that
much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The roles of children have generally
stayed the same over time; hence, their tombstones are practically the same
size.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tombstones for couples have
become increasingly popular over time, becoming more elaborate and massive.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From our research and previously mentioned
observations, we concluded that there is still a very obvious division between
males and females.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, we believe
that this difference is not necessarily based on the idea of a dominant and
inferior gender, but on the realization that men and women <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>are</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>different</i> from each
other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is most noted by the fact
that women’s stones were more sentimental, while the men’s were less so.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Overall, by looking at headstones, we can
see a notable, sex-based difference in the sizes and styles that suggest a move
toward equality.</p>
