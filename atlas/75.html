<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	<FONT SIZE=3>Imagine
if you will.  It is a dark stormy night.  The rain outside is
increasing and the wind begins to howl.  All you can hear is thunder,
and all you can see is lightning.  The news keeps flashing radar
updates on the radio and says that there is a possible tornado.  You
think as you sit in your bathtub in your little house in Conway
Arkansas, &#147;Could I possibly be in danger of being hit by a
tornado?&#148; You can be the judge of that after you examine the
following information on tornadoes and tornado alley.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	First
of all, one needs to know exactly what a tornado is.  What climatic
features cause a tornado?  What geographical features cause a
tornado?  Then, one should have sufficient information on what
tornado alley actually is.  What climatic and geographical features
influence this alley?  Finally, with this information a person should
be able to draw their own conclusions as to whether or not they are
in danger on a night as described above.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	What
is a tornado?  This question seems simple enough, but actually has
many complex factors involved.  A tornado is a vertically spinning
cell of wind that can reach speeds of nearly 300 miles per hour
(Clayborne, 2000). Many factors, climatically and geographically,
cause a tornado.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	Climatically,
tornadoes have potential to be much more common than they are.  The
United States climate is very good for tornadoes.  Tornadoes love
warm, humid air along low-pressure fronts that are frequently found
over the central United States (University of Michigan, 2000).  These
clashing fronts give a perfect spawning ground for tornadoes. 
Tornadoes are formed before thunderstorms when a change in wind
direction and increase in wind speed with increasing altitude creates
an invisible, horizontal spinning effect in the lower atmosphere. 
These winds are then hit by warm updrafts causing the horizontal
winds to move vertically in a funnel like structure (USA Today,
2001).  These updrafts are caused by convection of warm air as it
makes its way north.  The lower, warm air is less dense than the
higher, cooler air, thus the warm air rushes up when it meets a cold
front due to convection (USA Today, 2001). HERE INSERT A PICTURE OF
UPDRAFT! </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>Convective
caps and atmospheric layers work together to influence tornado
formation.  Strong upper level troughs moving across the plains cause
convective caps.  A convective cap acts like a cap over a body of
air.  This cap prevents convection from the warmer air (USA Today,
2001).  At the surface, southerly winds move warm, humid air from the
Gulf into the plains.  In the middle layers of the atmosphere, the
winds veer to the southwest and transport hot, dry air from the
southwest.  This forms a layer of hot, dry air in which the
temperature often increases with height.  At the high layers of the
atmosphere, westerly winds transport cool, moist air from the Pacific
Ocean which go up over the convective cap.  This becomes the perfect
setting for severe weather by having warm, humid air near the surface
and hot, dry air above it.  Then, adding cool, moist air at the
higher levels just intensifies the chance for severe weather
(Geoffery, 2000). (PUT U.S. AND WINDS PHOTO HERE).  (X-SEC OF
ATMOSPHERE HERE AS WELL).  From this data one can see that the United
States is the perfect spawning ground for tornadoes.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	Geographically,
the United States is very supportive of tornadoes as well.  The way
the U.S. is positioned gives us clashing of different humidities due
to mountain ranges, deserts, and oceans on both sides.  The oceans
cause moist, cool air to blow in from the west.  This air is then
forced up over the Rockies where it decreases in temperature and
moisture.  After rising over the mountains it settles on the warmer
air that is blowing up from the south due to the Gulf of Mexico and
its warm climate.  Then, hot, dry air that is caused by the deserts
and plains blows in from the southwest (Jennings, 1970).  All of
these different air masses have different characteristics due to the
different geographical features they blow over before they meet. 
This difference is where the entire tornado formation recipe comes
from. (SHOW A MAP HERE OF THE U.S. AND ITS DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIES).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	Now,
put these factors together over a particular part of the United
States and you can begin to see the path of tornado alley.  Tornado
alley is defined as the area of the United States in which tornadoes
are most frequent.  It encompasses the great lowland areas of the
Mississippi, the Ohio, and lower Missouri River Valleys.  They are
most frequent between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians
(Davies, 2001).  Taking into consideration the formation of
tornadoes, as discussed above, you know that tornadoes love warm,
humid air.  Also, tornadoes need low-level winds that shift
frequently, and grow stronger just above the ground.  Large storms
also grow best when there is no competition from other storms
(Rotter, 1997).  Most often, these requirements are met in the
central United States. (SHOW MAP OF TORNADO ALLEY ON UNITED STATES).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	In the
central U.S., all of these different air masses collide.  As these
air masses collide, they have no other option but to slide on top or
bottom of one another (Jennings, 1970).  When this happens you can
see the possible formation of convective caps as described above. 
When these convective caps restrict the convection of the warm air, a
lot of pressure is built up.  Then, when the convective cap is
broken, all hell breaks loose.  Typically this creates enough force
to cause a severe thunderstorm or a tornado over the central United
States in the region known as tornado alley (USA Today, 2001). </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	With
this information one should know why tornadoes form over tornado
alley, but what makes them use tornado alley as a travel route?  A
geographic look at the features of the United States reveals that
actually tornado alley is somewhat like a funnel for tornadoes.  A
cross section of the United States shows that the Rockies in the west
and the Appalachians in the east form high boundaries on the sides. 
Then, by looking at the cross section one can see that the gradual
slope of the land between the two mountain ranges comes to a valley
at the Mississippi River (Davis, 1992).  This acts as a boundary line
for a tornado to travel down once it is formed from the colliding air
masses.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	Another
reason tornadoes travel down this path is that tornadoes like to
travel the path of least resistance (Rotter, 1997).  Obviously this
path occurs between the two mountain ranges.  The tornado has nothing
blocking its path, therefore it just moves along with the front as
the front makes its way through tornado alley. (SHOW X_SEC OF US
HERE).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	Now to
answer the question, &#147;Why is Arkansas considered part of tornado
alley?&#148;  One obvious reason is that Arkansas falls in the
central United States.  Remember from above that the central U.S. is
where all the air masses meet and influence tornado activity. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	Another
reason Arkansas is considered part of tornado alley is because of its
proximity to the Mississippi River.  Remember from the picture above
that the Mississippi River is the lowest part tornado alley, thus
tornadoes tend to use this route as an efficient path to travel. 
Also consider that Arkansas doesn&#146;t offer many obstacles for the
tornadoes to run into such as mountain ranges or other geographical
features, and tornadoes like to travel the path of least resistance.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	So, in
conclusion, due to climatic factors present over Arkansas, as well as
the geographical position of Arkansas, Arkansas is definitely in the
path of tornado alley!  So if you are in your bathtub in Conway
Arkansas wondering if a tornado is going to hit your house, this
information should help you make your decision.  Our advice is hold
on tight; it could be a wild ride!</FONT></P>
