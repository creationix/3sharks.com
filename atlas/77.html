<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Imagine yourself
being at home one afternoon watching television.  For some reason you
walk to the front door to look outside.  You notice the sky is
getting darker by the minute.  Not being educated about the weather,
you do not know what is about to happen in the near future.  You do
not think anything of the dangers that could occur.  So you go back
to watch television.  As you are watching television, a tornado watch
appears on the lower left corner of the screen.  You are thinking to
yourself, &#147;Tornado watches aren&#146;t serious.&#148;  Then the
tornado watch turned into a tornado warning.  Now you are starting to
get concerned, so you turn to one of the weather channels.  The
meteorologist tells you that a tornado touched down at the
neighboring county, just southwest of the county you live in.  Now
the meteorologist says the tornado is now in your county.  You start
to panic because the storm is headed your way.  Your mind takes over
thinking the tornado is going to hit your home any moment.  Moments
later as you are still listening to the meteorologist, you hear that
the storm has past over your county and that everything is ok.  Now
you have a sigh of relief.  After all is said and done you say to
yourself, &#147;I am tired of going through this time and time again
without knowing why.&#148;  Similar incidents have happened to the
members of The Killatwisters.  That is what drove us to research and
answer the questions:  how do tornadoes form and what force do they
have, where is Tornado Alley and why is it where it is, and why is
Arkansas hit by tornadoes?</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">Tornadoes
are considered to be the most destructive forces of nature.  A
tornado is defined as &#147;An intense, rotating column of air
extending from the base of a thunderstorm cloud to the ground&#148;,
defined by Chad Palmer of the USA Today Weather Team
(http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wconvcap.htm).  The United States is
the world&#146;s capital for tornadoes.  Tornadoes form with the
combination of three components:  moisture in the lower to mid levels
of the atmosphere; unstable air, air that continues to rise once it
begins to rise near the surface, and a lifting force.  The most
common type of lifting force is geothermal heating near the surface. 
As the air warms it becomes lighter and begins rising.  Advancing
masses of cool air, forces warm air upward and triggers
thunderstorms.  As the rising air begins to cool, the moisture in the
air condenses to form clouds.  The rising air is called an updraft.
Tornadoes normally form at the front of an updraft.  The moisture in
the air falls back as precipitation, causing a downdraft.  This
illustration below will show how this happens and what it will look
like. (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://tornadothewebpage.terrashare.com/facts.html">http://tornadothewebpage.terrashare.com/facts.html</A></U></FONT>).</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><IMG SRC="sv9ce9cf.jpg" NAME="G1: http://tornadothewebpage.terrashare.com/drawing" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=365 HEIGHT=239 BORDER=0></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"> This is why
tornadoes are normally preceded by hail and rain.  The tornado pulls
all of the air in from around it, which feeds the tornado and causes
strong winds that can reach up to 200 mph.  Once a tornado has
formed, it becomes a low-pressure vortex, an area that pulls air in
due to the barometric pressure outside of it being higher than that
in the vortex.  That pulls air upward; this causes it to rotate.  The
low-pressure zone in a tornado continues to suck more air in.  The
warm air that enters the vortex rises and is cooled by the cold air
in the atmosphere (http//www.usatoday.com/weather/wtwist1.htm).  
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">At
one time it was believed that tornadoes produced winds of about 500
mph; however, this belief was proven to be false.  An average tornado
has winds of less than 112 mph and a base of 400-500 feet wide. 
These tornadoes move along the ground between 20 to 50 mph and are
limited to only a few minutes of travel.  On the other hand, there
are larger tornadoes that can produce winds of up to 250 mph; these
tornadoes tend to have a base of around one mile wide.  Tornadoes of
this nature are extremely rare, but when they do strike they can be
extremely deadly.  The larger tornadoes can sometimes travel on the
ground for over an hour.  
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">To
determine the strength of tornadoes, a scale was produced in 1971;
this scale is called the Fujita-Pearson Tornado Intensity Scale. 
This scale was named after Prof. Tetsuya Theodore &#147;Ted&#148;
Fujita also known as &#147;Mr. Tornado&#148;
(http://www.usatoday.com/weather/tornado/fujita/wfujobit.htm).  The
scale can be seen below.</P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">Now
that we know a little bit about what tornadoes are and how they form,
let us take a look at where tornadoes strike.  Throughout the world,
the United States is one of the most common places for a tornado to
hit.  Breaking it down even further, the central United States is one
of the most popular places for a tornado to strike.  The central
plains receive most of the tornado activity around April and May
(http://search.britannica.com/frm_redir.jsp?query=tornado+alley&amp;redir=http://tqjunior.thinkquest.org/4232/).
 The reason behind this is the topography of the United States.  In
the West lies the Rocky Mountains and in the East are the Appalachian
Mountains.  In between these two mountain ranges is the Central
Plains.  Warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea
moves   a low, which is a mass of cold air that pushes warm air up
quickly, moves over the Rocky Mountains and into the Central Plains. 
This diagram shows what happens.

<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">When a warm air mass
and a low-pressure area collide, they cause violent thunderstorms,
which can produce tornadoes.  &#147;Tornado Alley&#148; is the name
people have given to the area in which this happens.  Tornado Alley
consists of ten states:  Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kansas,
Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas.  This diagram
will show Tornado Alley
(http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/honors/student/tornado/alley.htm).</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Arkansas itself has
a history of tornado activity.  The reason behind this is because
Arkansas lies in Tornado Alley.  Tornadoes in Arkansas are just
something that comes with the territory, so to say.  On occasion
tornadoes happen in Arkansas at times when tornadoes are not really
expected.  A lot of this has to do with our fluctuation in
temperatures.  In Arkansas it is not unusual to be 60 degrees in
January.  This all goes back to the warm moist air driving north from
the Gulf of Mexico.  This fluctuation is temperature is what gives us
the rare tornadoes in January and February.  January of &#146;99 is
good example of this.  Tornadoes ravaged Arkansas because of a cold
front racing across the Ohio River Valley headed southeast.  At this
time, Arkansas was experiencing a warm air mass out of the Gulf. 
When these two collided the tornadoes where born

 The tornadoes of February &#146;01 are no different.  Tornadoes also
run across Arkansas southwest to northeast.  This is due to the fact
that a tornado will travel in the path of least resistance
(http://www.todaysthv.com/weather/wxguide/page7.asp).  The topography
of Arkansas is such that causes this.  If someone looks at a map,
they would see I-30 running from Texarkana to Little Rock, and
highway 167/67 runs from Little Rock to north of Jonesboro.  This is
the line that tornadoes like to follow.  It is the line of least
resistance.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	In closing of this
article, The Killatwisters hope we have done our duties of informing
you on how tornadoes form and their strengths, where Tornado Alley is
and why it is there, and why Arkansas is hit by tornadoes.  Our
purpose was to research specific questions that interest us the most,
so we could educate those we know and love about the facts of
tornadoes.  The Killatwisters hope this article serves the purpose we
set out for.  Remember, you may not ever know a tornado is coming
until it is to late.</P>
