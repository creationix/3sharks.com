<P>&#9;<B><U>What is &quot;Folk Music&quot;, what affected the writers of folk music, and where did American folk music come from?</P>
</B></U>
<P>&#9;&quot;Folk Music&quot; is a very broad term that has changed over the years.  Its roots include England, Africa, Native Americans, and even Central Americans.  The United States is full of rich culture in its folk music.  We plan to explain the definition of folk music, its origins, and its showing during some of Americas most trying times.  </P>

<B><U><P>What is &quot;Folk Music&quot;?</P>
</B></U><P>&#9;The term &quot;folk music&quot; is hard to define.  Some scholars consider it all the music produced by a certain group or society.   For Bela Bartok folk music was simply pleasant or comfortable music (Nettl 2).  Certain people consider it a type of music that characterizes a certain society or culture (Grosset and Dunlap 190).  One sign of folk music is that the music is not composed by a trained professional, but an untrained musician.  There is a strong feeling that the origin of a song determines if the song is folklore or not.  Another way of defining folk music is the way it is transmitted.  The most common way of transmitting folk music was spoken.  Many families passed traditional songs down through singing and reciting with other family members (Nettl 5).  Even many so-called primitive cultures such as American Indians, African Negroes and Polynesians used the oral technique of continuing folklore through the generations.  This type of folklore is the most commonly accepted today (Nettl 4).  This very broad topic of folk music is usually broken up into two major groups: folk music proper and primitive music (Nettl 5).   The reason for breaking the topic up is because the music comes from two different cultures: a culture with reading and writing skills and a culture with no developed system of writing or reading (Nettl 5).  Music in a society with fluent reading and writing sounds more cultivated and more in touch with art than a pre-literate society, where the music tends to sound less cultivated and strange to a civilized person (Nettl 4).  When it comes down to it, true folk songs are different to everyone.  Songs learned in childhood, from parents, relatives, and friends show a strong influence on one’s later musical development.  These types of songs are genuine folk songs.</P>

<B><U><P>Characteristics of Folk Music</P>
</B></U>
<P>&#9;Folk and primitive music is different than many other types of music in the way it is identified (Nettl 8).  Most genres of music are known by there musical sound.  Many folk and primitive songs are known for their culture and the way they reflect their culture and society through their lyrics though (Nettl 9).  One big use of folk music was religious purposes.  Many church hymns were the backbone for American folk music (Grosset and Dunlap 192).  The most important function was to serve as ceremonial pieces for the gods (Nettl 8).  Other cultures believed that singing songs would get the gods attention and they would answer their prayers.   Another big characteristic of folk music is the use of narration, or telling a story with the lyrics.  Many songs told stories of love, war, hardship, and celebration (Nettl 6).  The stories varied with the culture telling them.  The primitive folklore was more identified by the rhythm and fast beat of the song.  The composition of folk and primitive music usually tend to be short and concise.  The verse usually tends to be repeated several times.  There is always a sense of unity with folk songs.  There is always an underlying melody or rhythm in the hymns, whatever they are. Since we know a little bit about folk music we are going to look at where it came from and what affected the culture of each (Nettl 6).</P>

<B><U><P>Roots of African American Folk Music</P>
</B></U>
<P>&#9;African American folk culture began in Africa before coming to America.  The Negroes were introduced to America when slavery became popular (Nettl 50).  This is when African American culture was first introduced to America.  Many people believe that the Africans during the slave trades brought over all of the Negro culture (Grosset and Dunlap 120).  Other people insist that Negro music is full of British culture and tradition.  The ever-popular Negro spirituals have no connections with African culture whatsoever (Nettl 53).  This entire process is called acculturation (Bergman 203).  The process is where a culture adapts something from the other culture (Bergman 203).  This is because the Africans have become westernized by living in America for an extended period of time.  Even though these songs were once thought to be sole property of the Negroes, the songs and chants they sing are very closely related to Southern American Folklore (Nettl 53).  So in fact, these Negro songs are actually just white southern hymns with a twist.  The real location of African American folklore is a mixture of African culture with a side of original European culture (Nettle 55).  With slavery on the rise the Negroes were faced with many hardships.  They were being sold and moved south in to Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Missouri, and Texas (Grosset and Dunlap 192).  From all of this hunger, poverty, and despair came some of America’s most enriched cultural folklore in the history of our great country.  The acculturation process was shown again with the African Americans.  This time it was religion.  The had converted to Christianity while living in America.  This new faith gave them something to sing about on the farm.  The Negroes had one thing to sing for; Jesus Christ (Nettl 54).  They sang of their home in heaven one day after they would leave this earth.  Their songs were soul-filled anthems of the Jordan River, Jesus himself, and the pearly gates of heaven (Nettl 54).  This Negro culture was not appreciated until the Civil War.  Many northern people loved the spirituals and transmitted them all over the north (Grosset and Dunlap 193).  The African spiritual has been found to be a universal song sung by many blacks (See Figure 1).       It started as something to pass the time while they worked in the fields, but it has turned into a big part of American folklore and tradition. </P>

<B><U><P>The British Folk Invasion</P>
</B></U>
<P>&#9;Some of the oldest and fullest folk music in the states comes from Great Britain. These sounds all diffused together with American culture to form a single sound.  A popular form of folklore brought to America was the British ballad.  Many ballads brought from England date back to the fifteenth and sixteenth century (Nettl 38).  Even though trained musicians probably composed them, they show great examples of cultivated music.  Cultivated music tends to be written by an amateur musician.  Nevertheless, these ballads are passed into the folk tradition even though they did not originate in America (Nettl 39).  By definition, a ballad is a narrative song with five to twenty stanzas (Grosset and Dunlap 51).  Most likely, they served at accompaniment to dancing and celebrations.  They normally deal with murder or another sort of tragedy.  Even though they usually have a somber mood, most ballads have a happy ending.  The language of the ballads is a peculiar mix of American colloquial speech and old English literary conventions (Nettl 42).  Most older English ballads goes back to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  Many instruments of American folk culture date back to having English roots too.  The guitar, banjo, and most important, the dulcimer date back England (Nettl 43).  The entire history of the United States has been illustrated with folk songs.  From the time the colonies began, British Ballads told the story of the Revolution.  Then, as time progressed, many Americans began writing songs to tell stories of the history of America (Nettl 43).  These songs have become the backbone for American folklore.

<B><U><P>The Roots of Native American Folklore</P>
</B></U>
<P>&#9;The Indians are a group of people that have true American folklore.  This group of people was here in America a long time before anyone else knew this country existed.  They were the first people here, and they have great folklore in their stories and music before the white man showed up (Nettl 25).  What we know about their culture and music comes largely from investigating their life during the last hundred years, from diaries and reports of early white travelers and missionaries, and the artificial reconstruction of early conditions (Nettl 26).  The big difference in the styles of Indian folk music is two major periods, the time before the white man showed up, and the time after this.  Music was a very important part of the Indian lifestyle (Nettl 25).  They used music to talk to the gods, ceremonies, and for recreation.  Their use of music closely parallels most other primitive societies of this world.  Music was very closely tied in with religion in Indian lifestyle (Nettl 27).  We know so much about the Indian folklore, but in fact we know hardly anything about the origin of these Indian songs (Nettl 26).  The Indians were not considered great composers, and most of their music was from interaction with the gods.  From the Indians point of view, the songs they sang were gifts from the spirits.  From a cynical point of view, we know that the Indians composed these songs, not the Gods.  Most Indian songs had a very monochrome tone to them.  They did not consider their songs beautiful, they considered them good (Nettl 27).  The songs were for the pleasure of the spirits, not the Indians themselves.  This culture will always have a very rich folk history with generations of spiritual songs, tribal tradition and meaningful text in all its records (Nettl 28). </P>

<B><U><P>Conclusion </P>
</B></U>
<P>&#9;We have shown many different origins of folk music and how they were developed in their countries.  The process of diffusion is shown very well with the spreading of culture between different ethnic groups.  Another good point shown is acculturation.  The Africans show a good example of this by blending their culture to form another one.  A sample of Bob Dylan is on this disk to provide a sample of American folk music today after all the blending of cultures.  This is a small piece of the broad world of folk music.         </P>
