is an important resource that we must all use wisely.  In Arkansas
and in the world, there is limited supply of water, and it must be
used carefully.  The water that we have now is the same water that we
will always have.  Dinosaurs drank the same water that you drink. 
Three fourths of earth&#146;s surface is covered with water, but only
a small fraction is freshwater.   Of this freshwater, only a small
percentage is readily available for use.  The majority of freshwater
is either frozen in glaciers or underground (Zoller:1994:5).  The
water that is trapped underground is called groundwater.  Groundwater
is important to many people because it is the only source of
freshwater that is available to them (Pye, Patrick &amp;
Quarles:1983:15).  In Arkansas, 64% of all fresh water that is pumped
for use is groundwater, so it is clearly a very important resource
here (Renken:1998:2).  Understanding the processes behind groundwater
like how it goes into the ground, what happens to it once it is
there, and how the activities of humans affect it helps us to better
understand what we should do to preserve and protect this important
resource.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>	Groundwater
is a piece of an even bigger system called the Hydrologic cycle (see
figure below). This cycle starts when water enters the air by
evaporating from bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, oceans, etc.
 This water moves higher in the atmosphere where it forms clouds. 
These clouds move to different areas (upper right in figure) and will
eventually release their water as precipitation (rain, snow, hail and
sleet).  This precipitation falls to the ground where it runs down to
the lowest point, called runoff.  When water runs down the land, it
can pick up contaminates, such as soil, fertilizer, animal waste, and
other harmful substances.  When the water runoff goes back into
rivers and streams, these contaminates can get into this surface
water, making them unusable.  Even worse than that is if the
contaminants leech into the ground and get into the water table, they
can stay for quite some time and pollute water for years.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Imagine
the ground as a giant sponge.  Water that goes into the sponge is
absorbed and is held.  With groundwater, the spongy layer is actually
sand and gravel.  The space in between the rocks is where the water
is.  If you have ever held a wet sponge, then you know water leaks
out of the bottom.  Gravity is what causes this to occur.  With
groundwater, a layer of clay is beneath the sandy layer and keeps the
water from sinking through.  This sand/clay construction is called
aquifer.  Aquifers can range in size from a few hundred miles across,
to ones the size of California and can contain quadrillions of liters
of water (&#147;Ground Water&#148;: US Geological Survey Poster). 
Aquifers can also contain many layers of mini-aquifers that have
their own structure and form.  Such an arrangement is an aquifer
system (Renken:1998:2).  The structure of an aquifer is dependent on
how permeable the rock is from which the aquifer is made.
Permeability is the ability of water to move through that rock. 
Gravel has more space between it and therefore is more permeable than
sand, so water can flow better and faster through gravel.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>As
seen in the image above, groundwater does not just sit in the ground;
it actually flows through the ground (right to left in image). 
Normally this flowing through the ground cleans the water and
prepares it to be reused, but say, for instance, a gas station had a
fuel tank leaking; the introduction of substances into the ground
would spread from its source and be carried by the moving water
(&#147;Groundwater Contamination&#148;, Pye, Kelly:1984:42).  Two
views of groundwater flow with contaminates:

carry a substance quite far from its originating point, much like air
pollution.  The second picture shows a cross section of the first,

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Arkansas
has several aquifer systems with good groundwater; however, both
human activities and some natural processes threaten the quality of
Arkansas groundwater (Bryant: 1985:5).  Below is a map showing the
aquifer systems of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  The major
systems in Arkansas are the Surficial aquifer system, the Ouachita
Mountains aquifer, and the Ozark Plateaus aquifer system, as shown on
the map (Renken:1998:2).  There are also several other minor aquifer
systems.  Each aquifer and/or aquifer system faces different
challenges posed by the human community.</FONT></FONT></P>

             	The most important aquifer in Arkansas is the
Mississippi alluvial aquifer, which is part of the Surficial aquifer
system of eastern Arkansas and western Mississippi.  Groundwater is a
very important resource in this part of the state because of the
dramatic increase in soybean and rice production since the 1960&#146;s.
 As the need for more water for irrigation grew, the groundwater from
this aquifer was used to fill that need (Jackson:1984:2).  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>Of
all the groundwater used in Arkansas, 88% is used for irrigation, and
much of that is used to grow the rice in eastern Arkansas
(Smith:1989:26).  Problems in this area have arisen, though, as the
amount of water being withdrawn from aquifers has exceeded the amount
of water being recharged.  Groundwater levels have dropped one
hundred feet over the course of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, and they
continue to drop at an ever-increasing rate (Jackson:1984:4).  As a
result, the concentration of dissolved solids, like sodium, in
groundwater increases, making the water unsuitable for drinking and
irrigation (Bryant:1985:5).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>	Over
pumping has also been a problem in southern Arkansas.  There,
groundwater from the Sparta Sand aquifer (part of the Mississippi
embayment aquifer system) is an important source of water for homes
and industries.  As already noted, this leads to an increase in water
salinity.  This problem is compounded by the fact that this area also
has naturally occurring saltwater intrusion into its aquifers
(Jackson:1984:4).  This saltwater comes from deep in the ground and
enters aquifers through faults or permeable sediment (Bryant:1985:6).
 To make matters worse, the groundwater in southern Arkansas is being
polluted by industrial waste (Jackson:1984:4).  Industries often bury
their wastes in underground storage tanks, just as human waste is
often stored in septic tanks.  When the material from which these
tanks are made erodes, the waste seeps out into the soil and pollutes
groundwater there, as shown in the above diagrams of groundwater flow
with contaminates (&#147;The Pucker Effect&#148;:4-5).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>	In
northwest Arkansas, groundwater is an important source of drinking
water for rural communities (Jackson:1984:4).  The major aquifer
systems there are the Ozark Plateaus aquifer system and the Western
Interior Plains confining system (Renken:1998:3).  Compared with the
Mississippi alluvial aquifer, the Ozark aquifers are much smaller and
much less productive (Smith:1989:26).  That is why most larger
communities rely on surface water for drinking (Jackson:1984:4). 
However, for rural communities, groundwater issues are very
important.  Aquifers there have been polluted by both human and
animal waste.  Animal waste has become a major problem in recent
years because of the increase in &#147;factory farms&#148; where
large numbers of chickens, cows, and pigs are raised in close
proximity to be slaughtered once they are grown (Tolchin:1998:2-3). 
Because there are so many animals so close together, huge amounts of
waste are produced.  Unfortunately, this waste is being stored in
open areas where it seeps underground into water or in tanks and
storage units that are prone to leak.  In northwest Arkansas, many
streams and aquifers have been badly polluted from chicken waste
(Tolchin:1998:4).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
situation in central Arkansas is similar to that of northwest
Arkansas.  Groundwater is generally used in rural communities, and
surface water is used in the more densely populated areas.  The major
threats to groundwater in central Arkansas are from leaking septic
tanks and industrial waste storage tanks (Jackson:1984:5).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=3>	Because
people rely so heavily on groundwater for drinking and irrigation, it
is a very important resource.  Especially here in Arkansas, a better
understanding and awareness of groundwater among the general public
would be an important step in preserving this precious commodity. 
Government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency make
regulations for and monitor the quality of groundwater, but it is
really the responsibility of the people of each community to ensure
that their water is safe to drink.  Citizens should become informed
and stand up to farms and industries that are overdrawing or
polluting groundwater and surface water sources.  If we make our
water unusable, where will we find suitable water?  The water we have
now is the same water we have always had and always will have.  We
cannot afford to carelessly throw it away.</FONT></FONT></P>
