in the rivers and streams in Arkansas is a major factor in the
well-being of aquatic life and it also has effects on the life
downstream.  The major cause of pollution in Arkansas&#146; rivers
and streams is agricultural runoff.  Since farm animals such as
cattle, pigs, and fowl produce considerable amounts of waste that can
constitute a significant source of water pollution (Bergman &amp;
Renwick, p. 350), measures must be taken to regulate and prevent
problems before further damage is done.  The effects of the pollution
of farm animals are not only a state problem, but they are also a
problem for the nation.  The downstream flow causes the pollution to
stream into the Mississippi River eventually dumping into the Gulf of
Mexico.  The effects and regulations are to be discussed in further
detail later.  To understand the effects of the pollution, the
pollutants that are in the water must first be explained.</FONT></P>

from the waste of cattle, swine,  and poultry can amount to
significant amounts of pollution in rivers.  The major cause of
pollution in Arkansas&#146; rivers and streams is agricultural
runoff.  Animal waste associated with the production of livestock
(poultry, cattle, and swine) contribute significantly to non-point
source contamination of surface water in northwest Arkansas (Davis,
Nelson, &amp; Vendrell, 2000).  In fact, environmental activists have
said that the rivers in the northwestern part of Arkansas are already
polluted.  &#147;Of particular concern is the White River, which
feeds into Beaver Lake, the source of drinking water for much of
northwest Arkansas, including the towns of Fayetteville, Springdale,
and Rogers,&#148; (Kopsky, 1998).  An article in the </FONT>

County Daily Record stated Bill Keith as saying most people would
agree that the nutrients in northwest Arkansas may not be a problem
now, but they are on the verge of being a problem (Whiteley, 1998). 
Tests have been conducted by the United States Geological Survey
revealing that the Ozark farmland streams in this region contain more
nutrients from animal waste than most of the other streams in the
nation.  The animal wastes contain nutrients high in nitrogen
(Associated Press, 1998).  The effects of nitrogen in the rivers are
discussed later.  Other pollutants in waters in the state are
coliform bacteria including fecal coliforms and also fecal </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">streptococci
(Alexander, 1979).  Fecal matter in the water is the waste of
animals.  The coliform bacteria is bacteria whose presence in waste
water is an indication of pollution and potentially dangerous
contamination.  Fecal Streptococci is one of the most dangerous
contaminants found in the rivers in Arkansas.  Streptococci is a
bacterium that can destroy red blood cells and cause various diseases
in human beings, including scarlet fever and tonsillitis.  Two rivers
in Arkansas that have been tested are Hill Creek and Cypress Creek. 
Studies of these rivers show that the predominant sources of
pollution is livestock or poultry waste.  These pollutants can cause
problems toward humans and life in the streams.  If correct measures
are not taken to eliminate or lessen the amount of pollutants in the
water, the effects could be detrimental.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	Big
corporate giants such as Tyson and Cargill could be blamed for the
increase of agricultural pollution.  Tyson, a big chicken producer,
and Cargill, a big pork producer, are both big corporations that
raise fowl and swine and then sell their rendered products for
consumers to buy.  Although, the number of hog farms has declined by
50 percent since the 1980&#146;s, the number of swine in each
corporate owned farm has increased by 253 percent.  There are
approximately 400 of these huge operations (consisting of 1,500-6,000
swine in each) in Arkansas today.  There are also over 4,500
contracted poultry operations in the state (Kopsky, 1998).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	The
pollution problem is created from the waste of these animals, most of
these huge operations build manure lagoons where all the farms waste

 This &#147;karst&#148; is located just above groundwater, and is
very pockmarked (somewhat resembling a sponge) (Kopsky, 1998).  Being
so highly porous, this limestone has a very high risk of collapsing. 
When this happens, all of the nutrients are released into the
groundwater making the groundwater vulnerable to become contaminated.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	The
more serious long term pollution is taking place in Arkansas&#146;
rivers and streams.  Of particular concern in the White River which
feeds into Beaver Lake, the source of drinking water for much of
northwest Arkansas (Kopsky, 1998).  These manure lagoons contain
contaminants such as diseased organisms, residual hormones,
antibiotic residues, pesticide residues, and other organic matters
that make it unsuitable for the use of fertilizer (Fram,1998).  The
manure also contains high volumes of potash and phosphate.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	High
levels of phosphate in water can cause algae blooms.  Algae are a
group of aquatic plant-like organisms.  They grow very quickly,
especially when they have a good source of  nutrients (such as
phosphate).  Algae tends to cloud the water, making it much harder
for vegetation under the water to get sunlight.  When these submerged
plants are unable to reproduce, the habitat for aquatic life is
reduced.  Eventually these algae die and begin to decompose.  During
the decomposition, oxygen levels are lowered.  The lowered oxygen
levels make it difficult for aquatic organisms to survive (Fram,
1998).  Besides killing fish and vegetation, this algae also has a
great effect on Arkansas&#146; recreational waters.  The dark green
scum make the water extremely unattractive, giving it a bad odor. 
This has caused many problems for many guides, resort owners. Ron
Branaman (Manager of Gastons Resort on  the White River), claims
algae blooms have a dramatic effect on the resort business. He says,
&#147; Since we are a fishing resort, most people come here to fish.
Thus meaning, when fishing is best, so is business.&#148; He also
says, &#147;Every year the river experiences an algae bloom, but over
the last eight years they seem to be getting worse. Before the algae
becomes a problem, they could simply turn on the dam and flush the
algae away. They usually do this when it is too late; therefore, we </FONT>

says, &#147;Every year the resorts income drops by 45 % during the
time of these algae blooms.&#148;  Since the effects of the pollution
on the rivers and streams are becoming more severe, laws and
regulations are made to decrease these effects.	</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	Many
big businesses control the livestock and poultry operations in
Arkansas.  Individual workers work their farms for the big companies
also.  One problem with having big corporations is that they tend to
escape the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology with
violations made on the environment.  In the early 1990&#146;s, the
department allowed Cargill to double the size of their operation in
Mena even though they have had several violations against them
(Kopsky, 1998).   The department had issued 90 citations for over 20
violations including overflowing sewage lagoons, to not dispensing of
the wastewater correctly.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	One
contract farmer for Tyson food company was cited for a major
violation, but the fine was dropped.  The farmer had been dumping
exceedingly large amounts of animal waste from approximately 6,000<B>
</B>hogs into Mineral Springs Creek.  He had an irrigation line
running from the sewage lagoon to the creek.  As the water ran
through the line it would spill over onto the grass and kill it, due
to the high content of fecal matter.  The fine was dropped because he
told the department &#147;the leak came from another line used for
recycling waste water and had not reached the creek.&#148; (Kopsky,
1998)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	The
department has publicly admitted that over half of the state hog
operations have had numerous violations.  Most of these violations
were very dangerous such as leaks and overfilled lagoons.  The Public
Policy Panel, a public interest group support center in Little Rock,
found that the department only did inspections once every three 
years, when it should be done once every year (Kopsky, 1998).  When
the department actually does inspect, enforcement is rare and fines
are light.  The department also claimed that they did not have enough
staff to make yearly inspections.  In response to that problem, the
heads of the department made up a new plan, which </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	Since
there seemed to be so many problems concerning the laws of the hog
operations, the state of Arkansas came up with Regulation number
five.  It was the stiffest regulation in Arkansas history (Kopsky,
1998).  This regulation has to deal with the requirements hog farmers
must have to open a farm.  It is required that &#147;no confined
animal operation using a liquid waste disposal system shall be
constructed or operate unless the owner has first obtained a permit
from the department&#148;  (Department of Pollution Control and
Ecology [DPCE], 1992).  Before submission of an application, the
farmer must first put together a statement telling everyone his plan
to operate a confined livestock or fowl facility.  He must submit
this to his local newspaper and let this circulate for no less than
two weeks (DPCE, 1992).  When the copy runs, he must also state that
if anyone in the community has any problems or questions with having
the farm nearby, he must write his objections to the department
heading this project.  This person must also have the education and
training to accurately control waste and odor.  Then, they must
provide a permit application to the department (DPCE, 1992).  If this
information on the permit changes, the applicant must inform the
department of the change.  The Act goes on to state that &#147;waste
containment structures shall not be constructed within 1,320 feet of
the nearest existing occupied dwelling for confined animal operations
in excess of a certain number of animals&#148; (DPCE, 1992).  There
are also land application requirements for these farmers.  Waste and
wastewater has to be evenly distributed over sites.  They are not
allowed to distribute when the ground is saturated, frozen, covered
with ice or snow, or when there is over &#147;0.25 inches applied on
slopes with a grade of  more than 15 percent&#148;  (DPCE, 1992).  Of
course, they may not operate near public water sources.  The
applicant must also always keep sufficient records of their farms and
what they do with the animal waste, and they must submit annual
reports to the department (DPCE, 1992).  Over the years, however, the
department has become more lenient, and because of this, </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	Although
there are laws to regulate agricultural pollution in Arkansas, more
prevention from allowing these toxic substances from going into our
rivers and streams is now being taken into action.  Farmers can take
many measures in order to prevent pollution.  One method would be to
avoid spreading manure on frozen ground (Gegner, 1999).  Since the
ground in Arkansas is not frozen for long periods of time, this
problem can be easily avoided.  This will prevent any unnecessary
runoff when the frozen ground melts.  Also, the equipment that
spreads the manure, either a spreader or spraying unit, needs to be
properly adjusted.  This will make sure no excess fertilizer will be
sprayed or spread onto the ground.  Another system of waste
management is pasteurizing hogs.  When hogs are pasteurized, they
move around on their own without being in a confined space and they
are able to evenly distribute their manure without the aid of  the
operators, enabling the hogs to distribute the manure themselves. 
Now, with proper rotations and selecting stable, non-erodible land,
hazards of pollution into streams and waterways are reduced (Gegner,
1999).  The proper soil testing methods would be used for this.  The
soil then will not contain an excess amount of manure that will erode
easily.  If the tests reveal an imbalance, farmers can either apply
lime or other fertilizers to assume proper soil balance, or they
could even restrict application levels (Kuepper, 1998).  Prevention
can help more to reduce pollution caused by runoff of agricultural
waste than laws and regulations can.  Proper techniques to prevent
pollution should be taken to help keep Arkansas&#146;, and other
states, rivers and streams natural and beautiful.</FONT></P>
