farmland covered with black rot&#148;
(http://www.people.Virginia.EDU/~eas5e /Irish/famine.html). With
nothing good to eat the Irish peasants had to eat the rotten
potatoes. &#147;The peasants who ate the rotten produce sickened and
entire villages were consumed with cholera and typhus&#148;. Due to
the great spread of sickness, land lords were forced to pay for their
tenants to emigrate elsewhere sending hundreds of thousands of Irish
to America along with the songs of past loves, sorrows, and new
hopes. The civil war is the other main reason that the Irish
immigrated to America. &#148;Federal agents of the United States
lured Irish men to the United States with the promises of jobs on the
rail roads when the real purpose was to get them for the army&#148;(
Carl, Wittke 1956: 136 ). </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These two forces caused
relocation diffusion (refer to figure 3). Relocation diffusion is &#147;
The transfer of ideas, behaviors, or articles from one place to
another through the migration of those possessing the feature
transport&#133;&#148;(Getis, Fellmann 1998: 525). Once arriving on
the East Coast of the United States the Irish mixed with the other
immigrants from other countries. Folk music was then spread through
contagious diffusion as it mixed with other cultures and adapted.
Contagious diffusion is &#147;the spread of a concept, practice, or
article from one area to others through contact and/or the exchange
of information&#148;(Getis, Fellmann 517). The immigrants then made
new songs due to their own obstacles and daily life activities. Then
the immigrants went west in search of a new life while changing the
style of folk music in the process.(refer to figure Due to this
movement folk music went through another time period of relocation
diffusion. Due to this diffusion many styles of folk music formed.
There was the Northern Song, Black Song, Western Song, Southern Song,
and the main style to hit Arkansas the Southern Appalachians
Song.(refer to fig 4) Through this , geography, diffusion the spread
and development of folk music was accomplished in the United States.
Human geography is defined as: The interaction of humans with their
environment.  Music is a good medium through which to describe this
interaction.  Folk music particularly gets to the heart of the human
soul and its relationship to the environment.  People sing folk songs
for many reasons, and they are a major centripetal or uniting force
of society.  Learning the old folk songs in my family has almost been
a rite of passage.  They have been passed down from generation to
generation.  Through folk songs we have kept the memories of our
ancestors alive.  We have also understood their life, their beliefs,
their aspirations, their ideas, how they lived and how they died,
through song.  In other words folk songs are a reflection of the
culture itself.  Folk songs are an excellent cultural artifacts of
our society.  From these artifacts geographers could obtain a clear
picture of the environment and the human geography of the places they
were sung.  </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Folk songs are sung all
over the world.  The folk music of the United States is a rich
mixture of lyrics and tunes that are not only indigenous, but that
has been gathered from many different places.  The tenacious folk
song has diffused from all over the globe.  This proves the necessity
and the importance of them.  The human spirit desires expression. 
The folk song is the manifestation of that desire.  It exemplifies
the feelings of the human soul like nothing else can;  thus the
reason for its tenacious diffusion.  Not only has the diffusion been
contagious, which means it has spread from person to person in close
contact, it has also spread through relocation diffusion.  Relocation
diffusion is the spreading of an idea, disease or song through people
who have actually moved or relocated bringing the song, idea or
disease with them to the new place.  The songs are then assimilated
into the new culture.  For instance the Europeans that settled in
America brought their folk songs with them, along with the Africans,
and they are responsible for many of the folk songs that have been
assimilated into our culture.  Not only has folk music been brought
and assimilated, it has been developed over the years. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Folk music is still
developing, because as it is being developed it is changed and new
songs are created.  Every one of us can participate in the progress
of folk music.  For instance, I like to sing old folk songs to my
two-year-old child.  There is a beautiful old lullaby from the
Southern Appalachians called &#147;Buckeye Jim&#148; that I love. 
But there is a line in the song that I do not like about an old woman
dying of the whooping cough, so I changed it.  Now the old woman just
had the whooping cough she did not die of it, and that is the way my
children will sing it to their children and on and on, it is changed
forever in my family and the generations to follow.  Most folk
composers are adapters of old material rather than creators of
original set pieces.  The songs are changed to fit new situations and
people participate in its growth by reweaving the songs.  It&#146;s
like making a new quilt out of an old one by adding new scraps and
pieces (Lomax 1947:3).  That is the beauty of folk music and also
what sets it apart from other music - change.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Continual change is part
of folk music.  It is created by nonprofessionals and it lives by
being passed on from person to person, town to town, and country to
country changing and evolving in the process.  Alan Lomax, in his
book &#147;Folk Song USA,&#148; says, &#147;The art of folk music
lives on the lip, is transmitted by the grapevine and it reflects the
deepest emotional convictions of the common man&#148; (Lomax 1947:1).
 Since folk music is of the oral tradition, all the rules of
professional music do not apply.  Folk music is not published or
recorded.  There are no publishing rights, nobody owns it, nobody
receives any royalties from it and there is no name attached to the
bottom of the songs saying: Written by ________________.  All of us
own the folk song, we are the folks.  Folk music is sung by all, it
is part of our culture, our legacy and it is our national treasure. 
America&#146;s folk songs are homemade hand-me-downs of cultivated
poetry.  Alan Lomax sums up the connection between folk music and
American culture beautifully in his preface to &#147;Folk Song USA&#148;:</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Folk music has been
labeled, &#147;The ancient bonds that link the races and the nations
into the big family of humanity&#148; (Lomax 1947:10).  When you talk
about humanity you encompass all of peoples lives.  Everything that
people has gone through, they have sung about and wrote songs about. 
To understand their songs is to understand the people and their
lives.  Folk songs have flowered up out of the lives of people as
liberally as wild flowers.  Alan Lomax (1947:3) said that folk music
painted a portrait of the people that settled this land, an honest
and valid portrait.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The songs were created by
people who had a story to tell: Slaves dreaming of freedom, cowboys
driving their cattle, prisoners working on the chain gang, farmers
planting fields, or workers on the picket line.  The people told
their stories, laughed at their misery, and expressed their protest,
joy and despair in song.  The best and most moving folk song grew
from misery and frustration:  The moans and grunts of slaves, the men
and women working hard labor, and the prayers and protests of the
people (Berger 1976:33).  Woody Guthrie, one of the best known and
well-loved folk singers and writers, has said, &#147;Hard luck is one
thing you sing about louder than anything else&#148; (Berger 1976:20)
(refer to figure 2).  The folk songs reflect the deep shadows on the
landscape, the poverty, the graceless toil, the bitter hard lives,
the violence and the cruelty of the American people (Lomax 1947:3). 
Americans have made a 3000-mile march between the eastern and western
oceans,  their songs have traveled with them and were born along the
way.  &#147;Whatever is sincere and honest has in itself the power to
hold the human attention&#148; (Spaeth 1927:8), which explains the
permanence of the folk song.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Folk music has always
been a part of our American culture.  The Revolutionary War brought
us &#147;Yankee Doodle.&#148;(refer to figure 5)  Settlers heading
west to California in 1849 sang &#147;Sweet Betsy from Pike.&#148; 
In 1900 Texas farmers laughed at their misery in &#147;The Boll
Weevil.&#148;  The victims of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl tragedy sang &#147;So
Long It&#146;s Been Good to Know Ya.&#148;  These songs were carved
out of the rock of their lives and they are universal realities.  But
very few folk songs were sung just to entertain, most have a purpose
or a function (Berger 1976:11).  For instance, many were sung to
work, dance, or play by.  Some were sung to pass the time or tell a
story.  Many were written to protest an injustice, express courage
and stir enthusiasm.  Some were sung to carry the legends and history
of a people.  Songs accompanied heavy work, some to help sailors
heave up anchor or railroad workers lift heavy track, some to help
the men who were wielding the ax, picks, sledge hammers, hoes, logs
or bales of cotton.  The songs gave rhythm to the work, helped pass
the time and in some situations helped release the anger.  Coal
miners in the coal pits of Kentucky and West Virginia sang of their
misery, accidents and diseases.  The mill workers in South Carolina
had their own hell working at the giant cloth looms sixteen hours a
day in a life without hope, which they sang and wrote songs about. 
These songs helped promote self-preservation and social solidarity,
they also helped bring about social change and civil liberties. 
Melvin Berger writes, &#147;Songs were the strongest weapons of union
members, don&#146;t ever underestimate the power of a song.  It
sometimes brings about more change than a law or a bullet&#148;
(Berger 1976:15).  It has always been hard to silence a song of
protest.  The best known American songs of protest were the songs of
the struggles of black slaves for freedom and equality.  </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blacks from West Africa
had a big impact on American folk music, as well as immigrants from
Italy, France, Germany and many other lands.  The immigrants brought
the songs of their native lands and added them to the mixture of
American folk music.  &#147;The modern American folk song is made up
of the best ingredients, collected from countries all over the world&#148;
(Berger 1976:23) The British played a most important part in settling
this land and the music they brought with them dates back to the 15th
and 16th centuries.  The traveling minstrel, who sang the news of the
day, has been credited with many of the English tunes that were
brought over.  The British themes of love, war, battles, heroes, sea
voyages and crime were changed to fit the tunes.  The English,
African and American Indian music is mingled in the American folk
song.  The story- telling of England joined the exciting rhythms of
Africa (Berger 1976:30).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Americans have not only
created songs, but they have preserved them as well.  The first
settlers along the Atlantic coast lived in close proximity with much
social contact and their songs changed as members of other countries
arrived.  But as more and more new settlers arrived they were forced
to move to, and farm the hill country of the Southern Appalachian
Mountains.  There were no roads, few people passed through, they were
isolated and their songs were preserved with little or no change. 
There you could find the English folk song in its original form
(Berger 1976:32).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
you can see, folk music is the very essence of a society; society,
culture and </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>music
go hand in hand.  Folk songs are a form of expression that people
have used to express their joy, heartache, sorrow, terror,
unfairness, loss, etc., etc.  The list goes on and on.  All the
feelings that man has felt, he has written about and expressed them
through song.  The folk song has given us an outlet, it has given us
a voice and a demand for change, it has protested all the wrongs of
the world, it has praised and it has cursed.  As long as people live
and hope they will express themselves through their voice. 
Therefore, the folk song will never die.  As you open and listen to
the music I have attached, please remember the human suffering and
soul that has went into each verse.  Thank you.</FONT></FONT></P>
