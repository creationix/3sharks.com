<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tomato
to a memory</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The town of Tomato, Arkansas was
located less than a half of a mile away from the Mississippi River around the
late twenties and early thirties, surrounded by cotton and soybean fields, it
was considered nothing but a farming town. Tomato, located between Luxora and
my hometown of Blytheville, was also known as Canadian Reach then later called
Cedar Landing. Other than the farming, it also had significance in logging that
came down the river. Most of the logging in the area was just to clear the land
for more farmland. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Tomato received its odd name years
ago, in the early thirties, when a small group of community folk at the only
store was arguing over the name of the post office. When the owners' little
daughter came in for a can of tomatoes and said, &quot;Why don't you just call
it Tomato,&quot; which they did. (History of Mississippi County Arkansas, 1962)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Today the name Tomato is considered
just a spot out by the river where people farm. If one were to go out there the
only thing they would see would be the remnants of a few houses and the small
grocery store. At one time there was also a post office and a one&#8209;room
school. From what I have heard, there were close to one hundred and fifty people
in the area. (Joe Tillman, old farmer in the area)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Some of the reasons why Tomato never
really prospered was because of the location that was so close to the river,
and the threat of flooding at least once a year. Also the river's channel would
change its course and move to the other side of the river in a matter of years.
Another reason was that the town of Blytheville was created. Blytheville
exploded in a matter of a decade, so a majority of the people living in the
country started to migrate toward the prospering city looking for work, and
also people had more of a selection of products instead of one small store. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There were also a few railroads that
ran through the county that transported some of the natural resources around
the area, such as all the logging that was going on to clear the land for the
over abundance of farmland. Because of the vast number of acres being logged,
the majority of the northeast portion of Arkansas became nothing but a huge
dust bowl. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To date, Blytheville would probably
not even be half the size it is now without the industry it has. The only thing
keeping the town going is the steel industries all along the river. The steel
mills have a great location on the river, more than half of the transportation
of the steel beams is done on barges being shipped up and down the Mississippi
River.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Today the
only thing that will be found in the area that Tomato existed is farm&#8209;houses
and enormous shops that contain farm equipment worth hundreds of thousands of
dollars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There are a few other small towns
that should not have survived the growth of Blytheville, but the natives to
these villages stuck to their heritage, remained in the area, and kept the
small communities going with their farming. Even a few of the communities have schools,
ranging from kindergarten through the twelfth grade, as the heart of the small
towns. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Every
town, big or small can disappear in a matter of years. These communities have
very distinct pasts, varying from now non&#8209;existent towns to some of the thriving
metropolises that we may live in today. Whether these towns can compete with
other larger cities and towns in the area is not the only reason why
communities can disappear; there are many theories why, such as geographical,
political, natural, or economic reasons. The life&#8209;cycle of the three
towns that are being discussed have their own distinct personalities, one has
been engulfed into a huge metropolis, the next has all but become extinct due
to the larger towns located near by. The last community has been literally
blown off the face of the earth, there are a few remains that are spread out
over the area, but you would never know that it existed</p>
