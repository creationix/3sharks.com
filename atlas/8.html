<P>How has the birth rate of Faulkner County changed over the past few years and how does that rate compare to that of Arkansas?</P>

<P>&#9;The study of human population, also known as demography plays a important role in society.  The formal definition of demography is the "statistical study of human population, in its concern with spatial analysis"- the association of a population with its area (Getis 191).  It is useful for researchers to know how much a population has increased or decreased and why it has done so.  This is important for them to be able to predict how the population will change in the future and what affect it will have on society.  One aspect of demographics is the birth rate of a given area. Birth rate is composed of either crude birth rate or fertility rate. Crude birth rate, which is the "annual number of live births per 1000 population", is not as accurate since it does not take in to affect the age or sex composition of a population (Getis 193).  Total fertility rate is a more accurate statement in showing the total reproduction in a population.  It gives the average number of children that each woman would bear if, "...during her childbearing years, she bore children at the current year's rate for women that age" (Getis 194-196).  Fertility rate varies from region to region, depending on things like how developed and the age composition of the area.  This paper will focus on the how the birth rate of Faulkner County has changed and how it compares to that of Arkansas.</P>
<P>&#9;The trends in fertility rate for Faulkner County and any other county for 1991 to 1995 can be obtained from the Arkansas State Health Department.  The state health department calculates this rate by dividing the total number of births by the total number of women who are of child bearing age (age 15-44).  It is also important to note that while births to women less than 15 or more than 44 years are included in the general fertility rate, the population for those ages are not.  These births represent only a minute portion of the total births according to the state health department.  For example in 1995 births to this cohort of women represented only one half of one percent of all births in the state.  This portion of women are important from a medical perspective, but are not a prominent proportion of the total.  These methods of calculating hold true for individual counties, like Faulkner, and for the state as a whole.  Also the fertility rate only includes live births and is not a pregnancy rate.(Trends in Fertility)</P>
<P>&#9;The general fertility rate for Faulkner County in 1991 was 57.9 per 1000 and the county ranked 65th out of 75 counties.  In 1992 the rate dropped significantly to 53.0 per 1000 and left the county ranked number 73.  The rate continued to drop and in 1993 it was 51.6 per 1000 but Faulkner county ranked two places higher.  The fertility rate changed directions in 1994, increasing to 52.7 per 1000, making the county 72nd.  In 1995 the rate jumped to 56.8 per 1000 and increased Faulkner County's rank in the state to 68th.  The total average was 54.4 per 1000, which was notably lower than the total state average.  The fertility rate is specific and can be broken down into various cohorts such as teen fertility rate and births to unmarried women.  The total average rate for teens was 40.9 per 1000 and that ranked the county last.  Faulkner county ranked 57th with a fertility rate of 20.2 per 1000 for unmarried women age 15-44.(Trends in Fertility)</P>
<P>&#9;The remaining counties as a whole varied significantly as far as birth rate from Faulkner County.  The overall average fertility rate for Arkansas was 67.5 per 1000.  From 1991 to 1995 the rate remained fairly close, ranging from 66.4 to 68.4 per 1000.  Arkansas averaged 34,905 total births while Faulkner county alone averaged 940 births.  The rate of teen pregnancies, women 15-19, for the state 77.4 per 1000 was substantially greater than the 40.9 per 1000 for Faulkner County.  The rate for unmarried women for Arkansas, 31.5 per 1000, was also greater.(Trends in Fertility)</P>
<P>&#9;Many factors can affect the birth rate of an area such as the composition of the region.  The composition would include the age, race, and sex of the population.  Another factor influencing the birth rate is the total migration to and from the area.  As the following graphs illustrate Faulkner county had less international migration than did Arkansas.  However,  a higher rate of  people living in the United States moved to Faulkner County than the average county.</P>
<P>&#9;Birth rates are a part of what composes the study of demographics, which is the study of the relationship of the size of a population to its region.  Researchers can analyze the past trends in fertility and use this information to predict future trends. </P>
