mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
white-tailed deer have inhabited this region for roughly fifteen to twenty
million years (Cartwright, Patterson, Peterson, Poarch, and Sutton: 1996a).
They were allowed to exist without pressure from humans for almost the entirety
of this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Indian tribes that
formerly inhabited this area hunted the white-tailed deer only when necessary
for survival and did not have a drastic impact on the overall population of the
species (Cartwright, Patterson, Peterson, Poarch, and Suton: 1987b).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, when white men started settling in
this area, they often times killed the white-tailed deer in absurdly large numbers
to sell for profit or for specific cuts of meat.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>This did not have an adverse affect immediately, but as the human
population increased, the white-tailed deer became increasingly scarce
(Donaldson, Holder, Hunter: 1951).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>&quot;By 1930 the white-tailed deer population of Arkansas had been
reduced to only 500 animals&quot; (Cartwright 1996a: 10).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To protect the white-tailed deer and other
wild game in our state, The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission was created in 1915.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This leads us to the purpose of this paper,
which is to find out how the introduction of rules and regulations set forth by
The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission has affected the white-tailed deer
population in the state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When
The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission was formed in 1915, the commission's
intended effects were not immediately felt in the population of wild game in
the state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This inability to stop or
curb the population decrease, especially in the case of the white tailed deer,
caused the general public to become concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This concern prompted immediate action, and government officials
promptly passed an act that defined a 61-day open season for deer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This season ran from November 11 to January
10 and allowed the harvest of two deer per person (Cartwright 1987b).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, the newly formed commission still
faced several challenges before things would start to improve for them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first challenge they had to overcome was
the problem of lack of funding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They
could afford only eighty game wardens to cover the entire state, and these men
did not even have the power to make arrests (Cartwright 1996a).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second obstacle that The Arkansas Game
and Fish Commission had to hurdle was the great flood of 1927.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This huge flood covered a large portion of
the vast delta of eastern Arkansas, pushing the remaining deer onto isolated
patches of high ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These deer
herds were devastated by local hunters who took advantage of the situation
(Cartwright 1987b).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After such a rough
beginning it would have been easy for The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission to
have just given up, but the struggle to save the white-tailed deer was about to
take a drastic change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was stated earlier in this paper that in 1930 the white-tailed deer population
in Arkansas had dwindled to 500 animals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The majority of these remaining white-tailed deer were located in two
remote regions of Arkansas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They were
the Sylamore Creek area of the Ozark Mountains and the vast bottomlands of the
White and Arkansas rivers (Donaldson 1951).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>To keep these precious few remaining white-tailed deer from being
wastefully killed, and therefore making them virtually extinct in Arkansas, The
Arkansas Game and Fish Commission decided to create refuges for them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1926 and 1927 the commission bought, with
funds raised by taxes and the sale of hunting licensees, enough land to go
along with land grants from the government so that they could create several
state and federal game refuges (Morrison 1980).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>These refuges were conveniently located in the remote and
somewhat hard to reach regions that were mentioned earlier.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This allowed the white-tailed deer to remain
in a relatively safe place while their populations grew.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It became apparent that these steps alone
would not bring the full-scale turnaround of the white-tailed deer population.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At this point in time, The Arkansas Game and
Fish began another phase of their plan to replenish &quot;The Natural
State&quot; with white-tailed deer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;The
Arkansas Game and Fish Commission also started a deer restocking program, at
first buying white-tailed deer from private herds and later trapping them on
refuges for relocating in unoccupied parts of their former range&quot;
(Cartwright 1987b).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This statement by
Cartwright gives an excellent overview of how The Arkansas Game and Fish
reestablished white-tailed deer herds throughout their previous vast
domain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The continued support and
compliance of the general public and the government, as well as the excellent
habitat of this region allowed for the deer population to grow at an
exponential rate (Donaldson 1951).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A
chart showing this characteristic may be viewed at the back of this paper.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“By 1946, the statewide deer population had
grown to an estimated 31,617 with deer present in 71 of the state's 75
counties” (Cartwright 1987b: 8).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Censuses such as this one were carried out by pilots in small planes
counting the growing herds of the state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>These censuses showed that by the 1980's the white-tailed deer had made
a complete recovery, and in some cases had become too frequent (Cartwright
1996a).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This topic of overpopulation
will be discussed later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because of
several factors, including the diverse areas of human population and physical
geography of the state of Arkansas, the density of deer populations varies from
region to region.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
stated above, the diversity in the physical features of Arkansas plays a
pivotal role in where large populations of deer will reside.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>White-tailed deer can thrive in an
environment that produces plentiful food such as acorns, wild grass seed, and
agricultural products such as corn, soybeans, and wheat ( Hirth 1977).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Along with this abundance of food, they must
also be afforded the right habitat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This habitat consists of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>forest
edge, open woodlands, brush land, and second growth hardwoods (Morrison
1980).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore, the regions of the
state that most closely fit these characteristics are going to have the largest
deer populations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Arkansas can be
divided geographically into four major sections.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They are the Ouachita Mountains, the Ozark Mountains, the Delta
Region, and the West Gulf Coastal Plain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The Ouachita and Ozark Mountain ranges cover much of the western,
northern, and central sections of the state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The Delta Region covers nearly all of the eastern section of the state.
The fourth region is the West Gulf Coastal Plain, which covers a good deal of
the southern section of the state (Cartwright 1996a).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The Arkansas Game and Fish must treat each of these regions
differently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They each have their own
obstacles to overcome so that a constant population of deer may be maintained.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
four regions of Arkansas can be further subdivided into regional hunting
zones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These zones are created based on
deer population, densities, habitat quality and distribution, human population
densities, physical features, and sociological<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>and political influences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since
1987, the state has been subdivided into twenty zones (Cartwright 1987b).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The overall goal of each hunting zone is to
maintain a population of deer, which can easily be sustained by the region's
resources(Gavin 1984).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To reach this
goal The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission must accommodate the deer season, to
the deer population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An excellent
example of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the commission customizing
the hunting season occurs in the southern regions of the state, near hunting
zones 12,14,15, and 19 (Deer Zones Map).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In these zones, there is a substantially longer season, coupled
with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>a more liberal limit on the deer
you are allowed to harvest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The longer
season and larger limits are in response to the overpopulation, which is
occurring in that part of the state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The Gulf Coastal Plain Region of southern Arkansas accounts for nearly
sixty percent of the statewide deer harvest each year (Cartwright 1987b).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A
factor that The Arkansas Game and Fish has to consider when setting its annual
rules and regulations is urbanization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The fact that our cities and towns are expanding at a rapid rate has a
large impact on the deer population in that area.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>When people build houses and roads through the habitat of the
white-tailed deer, there will be encounters with them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is the reason that so many deer are
killed each year in automobile accidents (Hirth 1977).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Humans also must take into consideration the
fact that once they take their habitat, the deer must find some place to
go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This often times ends up with the
situation of people having deer eating the grass out of their yards, or
rummaging through their trash. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are several categories of deer hunting that are provided in Arkansas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>They are modern gun, muzzle loading, and
archery season.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each regional hunting
zone has specific dates during which each are allowed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission
sets the limits and dates for the next hunting season,<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>they must consider the population of the
deer herd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>&quot;Biologists monitor
deer herds based on knowledge of population changes and production&quot;
(Cartwright 1987b:12).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They can make an
estimate of how many deer can be taken without hurting next year's crop.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A good estimate is that 30-40 percent of the
deer herd may be harvested without harming the overall population of the herd
(Cartwright 1987b).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
you can see, The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission has taken gigantic steps
since its founding over eighty years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The commission has brought the white-tailed deer population of Arkansas
back from the brink of extinction to a thriving existence all over the
state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The challenges that face this
organization will undoubtedly change in the future, just as they have in the
past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The experience and knowledge that
they have gained thus far will definitely allow the commission to flourish in
the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
