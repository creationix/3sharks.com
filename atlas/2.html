In December of 1811, Arkansas was part of an event that helped to reshape the United States. An earthquake struck the New Madrid fault zone and was felt in Arkansas as well as several other states. The question at hand is, is there and earthquake in our future? Another question is, what exactly causes earthquakes in general and to what extent would the damage be if and when an earthquake strikes again at the New Madrid fault?</P>
<P><BR>
Most people have a poor understanding of what actually causes an earthquake, in order to truly understand earthquakes you must understand plate tectonics.  Plate tectonics are simply the idea that the earth’s crust is fragmented into smaller pieces called plates, which float on the mantle.  The heat from the earth’s core moves up into the mantle and causes what are called convection currents.  These currents push the fragments of the crust in different directions much the way currents in a lake or river move a log. (Bergman-Renwick 1999: 91) These movements of the crust will bring some of the plates together along plate boundaries.  There are three main types of plate boundaries, and they are divergent plate boundaries, convergent plate boundaries, and transform plate boundaries.(Keller-Pinter 1996: 34)  Divergent plate boundaries are places where two plates are moving away from each other, many of which occur on the ocean floor.  Convergent plate boundaries, however, are exactly the opposite, instead of moving apart the two plates are moving toward each other.  When this occurs one the denser plate will slip underneath the other and go into the mantle.  The last type is completely different, transform plate boundaries occur when two plates are grinding past each other, such as California’s San Andreas Fault.  These boundaries are hot beds for earthquakes. (Bergman-Renwick 1999:96)</P>
<P>It is easy to see how these massive chunks of rock, floating on a sea of molten rock could create such a powerful disaster like an earthquake when they collide.  But what really causes an earthquake?  After all, if all it took to have an earthquake were two plates colliding with each other then earthquakes would be a constant occurrence.  The answer to this is that earthquakes occur when the plates slip.  A good example is the San Andreas Fault, in which the Pacific plate and North American plate grind together.  Obviously the plate boundaries are not smoothed out and polished, instead they are jagged and rough, allowing one plate to catch on another, much like two pieces of sandpaper rubbed together.  Once enough force has built up the area of rock caught up on the opposite plate breaks and causes the plate to shift very quickly, this is an earthquake. (Bergman-Renwick 1999:91) This explanation would be acceptable for earthquakes in California's San Andreas Fault zone, but not for the New Madrid. This reasoning stems from the fact that there are no plate boundaries along this fault. The New Madrid fault is considered a failed rift because of upwellings that occurred 500 million and 100 million years ago weren't strong enough to split the plate and form a ridge (Heard 1999:19A).  Since there are no plates near the New Madrid Fault line, earthquakes that occur along it are considered mid-plate or intra-plate earthquakes<FONT SIZE=2>.  </FONT>  So, the question of why did these earthquakes occur still stands.  According to Gary Patterson, director of information services for the Center for Earthquake Research and Information in Memphis, Tennessee, "It is an enigma"(Heard 1999:19A). The New Madrid Seismic Zone consists of three major fault lines. The first runs from Carruthersville, Missouri, southwest to Marked Tree, Arkansas.  The second fault runs from Carruthersville, north to Cairo, Illinois. Lastly, the third line runs from New Madrid, Missouri, southeast to Dyersburg, Tennessee (Heard 1999:18A). At the time of the quake, the area around the fault was sparsely populated. Only a few hundred residents lived close by. Luckily, the inhabitants lived far enough away from the center of the quake, the epicenter, that no records show that deaths occurred due to collapsing buildings (Penick 1981:110).  The recorded accounts tell of devastation to the area, but it is hard to distinguish which accounts can be labeled as fact. For example, author James Lal Penick, Jr. eludes that an account of the 1811 and 1812 earthquakes from Eliza Bryan may or may not be completely reliable. He states, "She clearly lived in New Madrid and experienced the earthquakes, but little else is known of her", and goes on to say that her account cannot be confirmed (1981:30-31). In Mrs. Bryan's account, she states that at approximately two o’clock A.M., December 16, 1811, the first "violent shock" was felt. She also described the screams of scared people and animals in reaction to the shaking and the thunder. The first instincts of the inhabitants were to move as far away from the Mississippi River as possible in order to avoid danger (<A HREF="http://www.hsv.com/genlintr/newmadrid">www.hsv.com/genlintr/newmadrid</A>).  Consistent with Bryan's account, the Mississippi River flowed backward for a short time and then began flowing normally. David Dale Owen provided evidence to support that the backward flow of the river helped to create Reelfoot Lake. He showed that the lake was created when sand and debris built up at the mouth of the creek, and when the Mississippi turned south again, the land filled with water creating the lake (Penick 1981:74).  It is evident that the 1811-12 earthquakes did occur, but no one knows why.</P>

<P>The 1811-12 earthquakes occurred long before any type of measuring devices for earthquakes were invented. In the early 1900s, an instrument known as the seismograph was invented (Heard 1999:2B). A seismograph measures and records the vibrations of an earthquake on a logarithmic scale from 0-to-9, indicating the magnitude of the earthquake (<A HREF="http://www.neic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/eqlists/eqstats.html">www.neic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/eqlists/eqstats.html</A>).<BR>
This scale is known as the Richter scale, named after its 1935 inventor Charles F. Richter (Bergman-Renwick 1999:91). Judging from the amount of damage caused by the<BR>
1811-12 series of earthquakes, seismologists propose that the first quake measured approximately 8.4 on the Richter scale.  Aftershocks that followed were said to be approximately 6.0 or above (Heard 1999:19A). Since the seismograph was not yet available at that time, it is hard to say how accurate the approximations are.</P>
<P><BR>
Each day there are movements within the New Madrid fault. In fact, thousands of earthquakes occur daily, yet few of them can be felt.  Only with the aid of a seismograph can these<BR>
vibrations be detected (Bergman-Renwick 1999:91). But how can the next big earthquake be<BR>
predicted when thousands of small quakes are happening daily? Is there some way for scientists<BR>
to know before it devastates the New Madrid area?  Seismologists study readings of seismic<BR>
movements around the clock in order to prepare for such and event. Even though the fault has<BR>
been fairly quiet for about the past 25 years, scientists predict that there is approximately up to a<BR>
sixty-three percent possibility for a quake in the future. In fact, the expected measure is to be<BR>
around 6.3 in magnitude within the next fifteen years. As the time period increases to fifty years,<BR>
the percentage of possibility jumps to ninety-seven (Heard 1999:2B). Arch Johnston, the director of the Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information summed it up when he said, "We don't understand well enough what's causing the earthquakes"(Heard 1999:18A). Therefore, to answer our original question, "Is there an earthquake in Arkansas's future?&quot; the answer would be yes. Thousands of earthquakes are occurring all the time. Whether or not it will be the "big one", no one knows.<BR>
</P>
<P>With such predictions made about the future earthquakes along the New Madrid Fault, one has to wonder how prepared is the Central United States for an earthquake, Arkansas in particular and, what is Arkansas doing about this threat?   The most earthquake ready area in the United States is California.  Its most recent earthquake ranged from 6.9 to 7.1 on the Richter Scale, killing 62 people, and causing over six billion dollars in damage, and California was prepared for an earthquake.  By contrast, shortly after California’s quake Armenia was rocked by a quake of roughly the same magnitude, in it over 25,000 people died and damages ranged over twenty billion dollars (<A HREF="http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/public/facts_long.shtml"><FONT SIZE=2>http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/public/facts_long.shtml</FONT></A>).  Obviously Arkansas is more prepared for an earthquake than Armenia, but it is no where near California’s state of readiness.  </P>
<P>While Arkansas does have committee that looks at the possibility of an earthquake in Arkansas’s future, it is merely a part of the Arkansas Geological Commission.  The committee is reliant on data from CERI and the U.S. Geological Commission for seismic data on the New Madrid Fault.<BR>
Earthquakes are not considered in the building codes of the housing and commercial buildings around the New Madrid Fault, which could result in massive damages and deaths if the &quot;big one&quot; hits.</P>
