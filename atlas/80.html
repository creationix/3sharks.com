<FONT SIZE=3>It has been said that an earthquake can be felt
somewhere in the world every ten minutes (DeNevi, introduction). Even
in these technology-rich times, earthquakes are still as difficult to
understand as they are to predict. As such, earthquakes are
surrounded by many myths. At least in this country, many still
believe that earthquakes are limited to the Pacific coast or that
they can be caused only by the conversion of two of the earth&#146;s
plates.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>But earthquakes can also occur well within continental
plates along cracks or fractures in the Earth&#146;s crust called
faults. These faults often occur in areas of the plate that have
weakened due to ancient volcanism (DeNevi, p. 85). One of the major
faults in the United States is the New Madrid Fault, located between
Arkansas and Tennessee just north of Memphis (see map). The New
Madrid Fault was responsible for a series of earthquakes in 1811
whose aftershocks continued for the better part of an entire year. By
looking at the New Madrid quakes, as well as looking at earthquakes
in general and what causes them, and by looking at the precautions
being taken by Arkansas and other states to help prevent earthquake
damage, we hope to gain a better understanding of mid-plate
earthquakes and how another major earthquake might effect Arkansas.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>The New Madrid earthquakes of 1811 and 1812 rank as some
of the largest quakes in the history of the United States since being
settled by Europeans. Its area of damage was over 600,000 square
kilometers and it could be felt in an area of 5 million square
kilometers. The area where the worst shaking occurred is two to three
times larger than that of the 1964 Alaska earthquake and ten times
larger than that of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The first two
quakes in the New Madrid occurred in Northeast Arkansas. The first
occurred on December 16, 1811. Because the area of the epicenter was
primarily rural, there was only slight damage to any man-made
structures. But the quake could be felt for 2.5 million square
kilometers

Although there was not much damage to homes or others buildings,
there was much damage to the landscape. As the ground rose and fell,
cracks were opened in the ground and trees were bent until their
branches became intertwined. On the steeper hillsides, the quake
caused landslides, while lower areas sunk further into the ground and
were covered in water from fissures. The quake also caused huge waves
in the Mississippi River that collapsed its high banks into the
water, washed away entire sandbars and islands, and sent riverboats
high onto the shore

All in all, the effects of the quake could be seen in an area
extending from Cairo, Illinois to Memphis, and from Crowley&#146;s
Ridge to Chickasaw Bluffs, Tennessee.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Earthquakes are caused by massive shifts in the Earth&#146;s
crusts. Certain parts of the crust are under constant stress. When
the stress becomes too much, the rock gives way, often far beneath
the surface of the Earth. As the Earth&#146;s crust shifts, these
shifts release massive amounts of trapped energy, causing the entire
globe to vibrate. Any earthquakes are caused by plate tectonics.
Where plates separate, molten rock emerges through a rift and forms
new, softer crust. Where plates converge, subduction causes one plate
to be pushed under the other and cooked down, again into new, softer
crust. This softer crust eases in shifting and can lead to
earthquakes. For instance, the San Andreas Fault in Northern
California represents the area between the Pacific Plate, which is
moving toward the northwest, and the North American Plate, which is
moving west. It is the sudden movement of one of the plates that had
previously been stationary for centuries that caused the San
Francisco earthquake of 1906 (DeNevi, p. 85). However, seismic
activity is not limited to the areas between major plates. Faults can
also occur in the middle of plates, possibly because the integrity
has been weakened by ancient volcanic activity. Eventually, the
strain within a faults builds up to the point where the fault will
collapse, releasing an immense amount of energy
(<A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/savageearth/animations/earthquakes/index.html">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/savageearth/animations/earthquakes/index.html</A>).
A perfect example of a fault within a plate is, of course, the New
Madrid Fault. A cross section of the New Madrid region shows that
bedrock lies as much as half a mile beneath the surface of much of
Eastern Arkansas (see Lowman map).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>Though earthquakes are virtually impossible to predict,
we can prepare for the damage they inflict. The problem with many
older buildings that have not been built to any sort of seismic
specifications is that they have been built deep into the Earth so as
to be kept completely still. Older architects have depended too
highly on concrete on steel to keep structure steady during quakes.
In this method, they fight a battle with Mother Nature that they are
incapable of winning. The immense forces behind earthquakes basically
cause the surface of the Earth to become like water, moving in waves.
The newly accepted paradigm for building earthquake-safe structures
is that of working with the force of the quake instead of trying to
fight it. Modern bridges and buildings are built to, within reason,
move with the force of the quake so that only a severe quake can do
any serious damage

A shining example of this new thinking comes from perpetual
architectural innovator Frank Lloyd Wright, who designed the Imperial
Hotel in Japan, a structure that has survived at least 11 earthquakes
that registered 8.0 or higher on the Richter scale. The Imperial&#146;s
foundation is built above the Earth&#146;s surface, and it&#146;s
internal structures such as water and electricity lines were designed
to allow a reasonable degree of movement, both factors that work with
the energy of an earthquake and have allowed the building to remain
standing during even these strong quakes.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Arkansas and the rest of the New Madrid region have been
at the forefront of earthquake preparation for the entire United
States. A 1992 testimony by then Arkansas Office of Emergency
Services Director James Lee Witt before the Congressional Committee
on Science, Space and Technology stated that by the year 2000
scientists had predicted up to a 63 percent chance of a major
earthquake in the central United States. <BR>Another federal
congressional document on reducing earthquake loss cites the New
Madrid region as one of the highest-risk seismic activity zones in
the country. In fact, charts created by the Arkansas Center for
Earthquake Education and Technology at the University of Arkansas at
Little Rock show that, among quakes recorded in the Central United
States between 1800-1983, the highest concentration of those quakes
have occurred in the New Madrid region
(<A HREF="http://www.eas.slu.edu/Earthquake_Center/SEISMICITY/cus1800-1983.html">http://www.eas.slu.edu/Earthquake_Center/SEISMICITY/cus1800-1983.html</A>).
Another chart shows a high frequency of quakes within the region
between 1975 and 1995
(<A HREF="http://www.eas.slu.edu/Earthquake_Center/SEISMICITY/newmadrid1975-1995.html">http://www.eas.slu.edu/Earthquake_Center/SEISMICITY/newmadrid1975-1995.html</A>).
The UALR study also predicts that 100 percent of Faulkner County
residents would feel a major New Madrid quake. According to the
predictions, a quake registering between 7.0 and 7.9 of the Richter
scale would cause 25 percent architectural damage in the county, with
a quake of 8.0 to 8.9 causing 50 percent architectural damage
(<A HREF="http://quake.ualr.edu/public/estimate/faulkner.htm">http://quake.ualr.edu/public/estimate/faulkner.htm</A>).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>In recent years, many scientists have predicted that the
New Madrid Fault is due to cause another major earthquake in the
Central United States. After the damage caused by the New Madrid
earthquakes of 1811 and 1812, Arkansas is taking no chances in its
preparation for any potential quakes in the future. History has shown
that the New Madrid Fault can be a devastating natural force, while
science has shown that it may be primed to strike again and could be
just as devastating. Arkansas: it&#146;s not just for tornados
anymore.</FONT></P>
