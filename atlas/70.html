<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">&#147;Several passengers from on board
a steam boat ascending the Mississippi in 1820, went on shore near
New Madrid.  While amusing themselves with a small collection of
books found in one of the houses, the whole house was so shaken that
they were scarcely able to stand upon their feet.  Some consternation
was, of course, felt, and much terror expressed.  &#145;Don&#146;t be
alarmed&#146; said the lady of the house, &#145;it is nothing but an
earthquake&#148; (Penick 51).</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%">	Arkansas is located in an area known as
the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ).  This zone is home of the highest
number of earthquakes in the United States, and has also experienced
some of the strongest earthquakes in U.S. history (see Appendix I). 
If an earthquake happened now would Arkansas be prepared?  Arkansas
would be severely effected by a high magnitude earthquake.  
Earthquakes cause severe damage and are considered disasters.</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%">	In the winter of 1811-1812,
northeastern Arkansas was struck by three of the most powerful
earthquakes in U.S. history.  Even today, this region has more
earthquakes than any other part of the United States east of the
Rocky Mountains.  The reason for these earthquakes is the New Madrid
Fault and the Reelfoot Rift (see Appendix II).  The New Madrid Fault
extends approximately 120 miles southward from the Charleston, MO
area down to Marked Tree, AR.  The fault is active and averages more
than 200 measured earthquakes per year.  Nearly every 18 months it
releases a shock of 4.0 on the Richter Scale or more and earthquakes
of 5.0 or greater are released about once per decade
(http://quake.usgs.gov/prepare/factsheets/HiddenHazs/).</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%">	&#147;The Richter Scale measures the
magnitude of the seismic waves from an earthquake.  The scale is
logarithmic; that is, the amplitude of the waves increases by powers
of 10 in relation to the Richter magnitude numbers.&#148;  An
equation can be used to approximate the energy of the earthquake. 
The equation includes this magnitude and the distance from the
seismograph to the earthquake&#146;s epicenter.  The Richter Scale
ranges from 0-9, although there are no set upper limits
(<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://infoplease.lycos.com/ce6/sci/A0841853.html)">http://infoplease.lycos.com/ce6/sci/A0841853.html)</A></U></FONT>.
 
</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%">	An earthquake is a sudden release of
energy within the Earth producing a shaking of the Earth.  But, does
an earthquake actually move?  In a way it does and in a way it does
not.  The place where the Earth&#146;s crust actually moves is called
the focus.  The point directly above the focus is called the
epicenter.  The earthquake itself does not move, the energy from the
quakes travels worldwide.  Bergman and Renwick have a great analogy
for this: &#147;an earthquake is like a stone being cast into the
water.  There is a disturbance in the homeostasis of the water
causing ripples/waves to spread out across the water.&#148;  The rock
is to the earthquake as the ripples in the water are to the seismic
waves (Bergman 91).  
</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%">	In the winter of 1811 around two
million square miles were shaken and up to 50,000 square miles were
topographically changed by earthquakes measuring above 8.0 of the
Richter Scale along the New Madrid Fault Line.  Through the months to
come, there were a considerable amount of earthquakes that took place
but with diminishing intensities.  A range of side effects from
raised and sunken lands to large landslides characterized the most
seriously affected areas (Coffman 43).</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%">	In Arkansas between the years 1811 and
1839 there were at least thirty earthquakes measuring close to or
above 4.0 on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.  According to the
Modified Mericalli Intensity Scale, the size of an earthquake is
measured by the degree of violence of the earthquake&#146;s motion
and takes into consideration the overall effects on people and both
natural and man-made structures (Coffman 2).  Such a reading means
that earthquakes were felt by nearly everyone, many people were
awakened, and trees, poles and other tall objects were disturbed
(Coffman 3-192).  One of the two earthquakes that occurred in the
year 1955 had its epicenter located at the
Tennessee-Arkansas-Missouri border, but was felt as far as Kentucky,
Alabama, and Illinois.  On January 1, 1969, another earthquake took
place in central Arkansas with a magnitude measuring 4.2 on the
Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.  This earthquake cracked floors
and walls in Little Rock and North Little Rock and was felt in the
southern parts of Missouri and at Memphis, TN (Coffman 54-57).  On
September 26, 1990, an earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter Scale
struck the New Madrid Fault at 8:19 a.m.  This event forced Arkansas
to realize that the New Madrid Fault is far from inactive, and its
history is not through being recorded (Gordon).  It quaked before and
it will quake again.</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%">	The highest risk for an earthquake in
the United States is along the New Madrid Fault.  If a major
earthquake were to occur, it would be felt through half the United
States (see Appendix III).  Damage would be expected in 20 states or
more, and Missouri alone has an estimate damage of six billion
dollars (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www2.semo.edu/ces/CES2.HTML)">http://www2.semo.edu/ces/CES2.HTML)</A></U></FONT>.
 Destruction covers more than 20 times the area because of underlying
geology.  Soil in the central United States is looser and sandier
than on the west coast; therefore, shock waves would travel much
farther and the same magnitude earthquake on the west coast would be
about ten times worse in the central U.S.  
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">It is hard to make
accurate estimates about damage because the last major earthquake was
in 1812.  During this time the situations were totally different. 
The damages and losses were only a fraction of what they would be
now.  Land, buildings, and roads were not developed as they are now;
and the populations were no where as much as they are today.  The
population of Arkansas in 1810 was 1,062 and the population in the
year 2000 was 2,673,400
(<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/resapport/states/arkansas/xls)">http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/resapport/states/arkansas/xls)</A></U></FONT>.
 Preparation is the key to minimizing the amount of damage.  More
prepared cities have proven to have less losses than other unprepared
cities.  &#147;Education, planning, proper building construction, and
preparedness     . . . are proven to minimize . . . losses, deaths,
and injuries&#148; (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www2.semo.edu/ces/CES2.HTML)">http://www2.semo.edu/ces/CES2.HTML)</A></U></FONT>.
 San Francisco was prepared and suffered 67 deaths and less than
seven billion dollars in property damage to a 6-7.1 magnitude
earthquake.  Armenia wasn&#146;t prepared and suffered 25,000 deaths
and more than 20 billion dollars in damage.  Missouri and the Midwest
are more prepared than Armenia, but only a fraction as prepared as
San Francisco and California structures are built to withstand
earthquake shaking.  Japan (all construction is done with earthquake
prevention in mind) was devastated in a 1995 earthquake with a
magnitude of 6.9 in Kobe.  The earthquake destroyed highways,
bridges, and buildings.  The structures were predicted by Japan&#146;s
earthquake-savvy architects to be able to withstand much more
powerful shocks.  The quake claimed 5,500 lives and produced 100
billion dollars in damages.  U.S. officials are scared of comparable
earthquakes in the New Madrid area where few structures would measure
up to Japanese standards (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.cusec.org/">www.cusec.org</A></U></FONT>)</P>

	During an earthquake most of the damage is a result of ground
shaking and fault slipping. When fault slipping occurs it causes the
soil to shift and move which can cause landslides.  Ground shaking
causes buildings to bounce up and down, sway from side to side, and
move in other violent ways.  Buildings can be shaken apart or slip
off their foundations 
(<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.worldbook.com/fun/bth/earthquake/html/howdamaged.htm)">http://www.worldbook.com/fun/bth/earthquake/html/howdamaged.htm)</A></U></FONT>.
 AN earthquake can also cause a building to be out of plumb, which is
caused by excessive horizontal movement in the exterior walls. 
Indicators that a building is out of plumb are broken glass windows,
jammed doors, and an offset of more than one inch from the top to
bottom of a wall (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://quake.ualr.edu/schools/guide/appenle.htm)">http://quake.ualr.edu/schools/guide/appenle.htm)</A></U></FONT>.
 In areas with soft wet soil disaster called liquefaction can cause
buildings to sink into the soil.  Severe shaking causes the wet soil
to behave as a liquid instead of a solid and everything on top of the
soil sinks or the soil can flow as a river and flow toward lower
ground and bury anything in its way.  Because we are so close to a
major river this is major problem for our area.  Fire can also cause
a lot of damage.  If the earthquake breaks or ruptures gas and power
lines it can spark a fire.  The 1906 San Francisco earthquake ranks
as one of the worst disasters in the United States history because of
a fire that raged on for three days after the quake.   Many people
depend on gas for cooking or heating their homes.  Other hazards
during an earthquake include spills of toxic chemicals. Sewage lines
may break, and sewage may seep into water supplies.  Drinking of such
impure water may cause cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and other serious
diseases

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">A non-structural
damage would be the disruption of commerce.  It is likely that if a
major earthquake hits it will cause all concrete roads, bridges, and
rail lines to be shot to pieces.  Most airports would be unable to
use the runways due to crumbling of the runways.  There would be a
devastating loss of farmland.  Land could dry up or flood and this
would lead to years of repair to those damages.  In the central U.S.
a major earthquake would effect the entire country.  A lot of
commerce depends on railroads and 18-wheelers, and this would be like
having a hole in the middle of the country.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">Estimated damages
for residents in Arkansas are serious injuries, fatalities,
displacement, damage to contents of buildings, architectural damage,
slight to severe structural damage, collapsed buildings, and
electrical and telephone outages.  Magnitudes of 5-5.9 on the Richter
Scale will not do much serious damage, but an earthquake with a
magnitude of 6-6.9, which is predicted for this area, is much more
damaging and could result in numerous deaths.  A magnitude higher
than 7 would be devastating (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://quake.ualr.edu.public/estimate)">http://quake.ualr.edu.public/estimate)</A></U></FONT>.

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">	Although the New
Madrid Seismic Zone experiences the most earthquakes, it is lagging
in preparation for another major one.  The NMSZ is making big steps
to becoming prepared.  In 1983, seven states including Arkansas,
established the Central United States Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC)
to &#147;improve public awareness of earthquakes . . . promote
earthquake resistant building codes . . .&#148; and other various
preparations (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.CUSEC.org)/">http://www.CUSEC.org)</A></U></FONT>.
 The CUSEC&#146;s primary mission is &#147; . . . the reduction of
deaths, injuries, property damage and economic losses resulting from
earthquakes in the Central United States&#148;.  They have stressed
mitigation, research, resource development, and constituency
building.  Earthquakes measuring 6.7 in California caused 20 billion
dollars in damage and claimed 33 lives, and that is a &#147;prepared&#148;
city.  This region is now home to millions of people, unlike in 1811,
and structures were not built to withstand earthquakes.  Earthquake
preparations have also lagged behind.  CUSEC is attacking all these
problems to better prepare Arkansas and other states for the next New
Madrid earthquake (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.Cusec.org)/">http://www.Cusec.org)</A></U></FONT>.
 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">There are few
insurance companies in Arkansas that provide earthquake insurance
under the standard homeowner&#146;s insurance.  Insurance companies
have seen no need for worrying about earthquake damage.  Earthquake
insurance can be purchased separately.  Deductibles under the
earthquake policies are usually five or ten percent with 500 dollars
being the minimum. <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">If
the coverage fails to go into effect before the earthquake, there is
no coverage, which will be a problem since most people have not
purchased earthquake insurance.  Earthquake coverage is rated based
on the construction of a building and the zone it is located in, for
example Pulaski County and Faulkner County are in zone four whereas
the rates in zone two are the highest.  Counties in this zone are
Clay, Craighead, Crittendon, Greene, Cross, Jackson, and Poinsett. 
Zone two is closer to the New Madrid Fault than zone four; therefore,
it would be expected to receive more damage and losses (Smith,
personal interview).</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">There
is no doubt that there would be extensive damages to the New Madrid
Seismic Zone if a major earthquake were to occur.  With organizations
like CUSEC we can become educated and prepared.  We can cut losses
and damage if we only take the time to prepare.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
