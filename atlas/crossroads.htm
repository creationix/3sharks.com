uniquely ours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We look to Paris and

the first mass marketed car, but German and Italian designers create better
vehicles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The microwave, an American
invention, was reverse engineered by the Japanese and now they are the ones who

in the mists of time, but there are some generally accepted ideas as to where
it came from and how it developed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One
idea says that the blues were actually a form of African music that transmitted
the traditions and sufferings African slaves experienced.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These songs covered a wide range of subjects
from work to love to spiritual music (Carney, 55).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Another idea is that the blues came from black sharecroppers who
lived together in large communities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>These communities did not quite have the same conditions that slaves
faced, but living was pretty hard (Carney, 56).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Also, in these communities, different African tribal groups were
thrown together and these songs were one way to communicate traditions through
music to their children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>

<p class=jeffrey1 style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>According to George Carney, the new world
instruments were unfamiliar to the slaves, but they were able to express their
tribal music through vocal chants and the rhythmic banging of work implements
(Carney, 57).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After the Civil War, the
musicians had freedom to travel where they wanted.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In order to do this, they needed easily transportable
instruments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result, early blues
musicians primarily used the guitar and harmonica.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Both of these instruments are inexpensive and easy to carry which
allowed the musicians to be fairly mobile with their songs.</span></p>

Johnson’s impact on blues culture and the development of guitar styles has been
substantial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An interesting point is
that Johnson only recorded 29 songs, but these songs have been more closely

to play with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then, mysteriously,
his disappeared for a brief while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When
he returned, his skill was much greater than it should have been.<span

reality stops and myth begins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
question of where his sudden spurt of talent came from is one idea that allows
the myth to continue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also, Robert
talked about Hellhounds being on his trail and the fact that the Devil himself
was after him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A large part of his
music deals with this subject and good verses evil.<span style="mso-spacerun:

artists and some shrewd marketing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
myth started when other blues musicians speculated on where Robert’s sudden
talent had come from (Blue Flame).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Probably to keep the mystique alive and to practice stuff that would not
be copied until he had an opportunity to perform it, Robert practiced in
graveyards in the middle of the night.</span></p>

development of a people and of how it responded to the environmental changes
that were thrust upon it (Carney, 55).” Blues music has its roots in the
struggles of African slaves who yearned for freedom and a better life.<span

free, but still tied to the land in a sharecropping system.<span

major communication routes, such as railways and the Mississippi river (Carney,

slow was that the artist had to be physically present.<span

America to the Blues (Lee, 132).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>W. C.
Handy eventually collaborated with Harry Pace, a small town songwriter, (Lee,

sensation on Broadway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Perhaps Handy’s
greatest idea was to have a woman front the Blues.<span style="mso-spacerun:
