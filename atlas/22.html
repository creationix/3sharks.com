<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The helicopter
zooms over the mountain, trying desperately to keep Noah Mappa in sight of
their curious camera.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The crew can see
the trail snaking past hill after hill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Noah cruises dangerously fast on his Mongoose ten-speed road bike.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trees impede the vision of the
inquisitive camera crew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the ground,
twigs slap ferociously at Mappa, leaving scratches on his bone-weary face.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Only adrenaline is pushing him to keep on
going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A blind turn looms ahead.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A moment of panic passes through his blood,
but quickly subsides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is no
traffic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All is well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The curve approaches, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Noah Mappa swerves into the
shoulder to make the turn more easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>All of a sudden, the shoulder disappears and is replaced by a concrete
wall 42.5 feet tall and 12 feet thick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Poor Noah never knew what hit him…or rather what he hit.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Noah could have avoided this cataclysmic
fate with one simple thing—a map of his bike trail.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>To help other cyclists evade a similar demise, we have constructed
three bike trails of our own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We determined our
three bicycle paths by finding places near Conway that we thought would be
scenic and bike-ride worthy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We were
curious to know if they would be suitable for bicycle routes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We already knew about one route that was
hilly, and we wanted to see if the shoulders were acceptable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This course, which we later named Kitty
Path, is an “out and back” route, meaning that it does not make a circle.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We chose the other two trails, later named
Cossman Pass and Lance Armstrong Trail, by looking at an Arkansas map (Arkansas
Atlas &amp; Gazetteer 41, Ballard, Greenbrier, and Tyler) and finding a winding
road in a place unknown to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
determined the classification of these trails with the terms excellent, good,
fair, and poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Excellent implies that
two cyclists can ride on the shoulder safely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Good states that one cyclist could ride on the shoulder.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Fair means that there is no shoulder but
little traffic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Poor entails that there
is no shoulder with high traffic, high-speed traffic, or impossible
maneuverability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In mapping, we
considered landforms, grade, shoulders, and visibility around curves
(Bennett).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kitty Path, which is 18.8 miles,
is for the inexperienced rider.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cossman
Pass, which is 32.3 miles, is for experienced riders.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Lance Armstrong Trail is 68 miles and is only for
professionals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We have mapped the
trails, the topography of each trail, and the shoulders to warn cyclists of
what is to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Kitty
Path starts at Beaverfork Overlook Dock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The first half- mile is poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>There is no shoulder, and the road is semi-steep and curvy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At .6 miles, the shoulder widens to good,
and the road flattens to accommodate one cyclist.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Be careful of the bridge and the steep downhill curve.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>The second mile continues with the good
shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The path has a couple of
gentle curves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It does not have a steep
slope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After these curves, the road straightens
and stays flat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At mile three, the
shoulder is still good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The road
gradually climbs with a giant downhill curve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A bridge greets the rider at the bottom of the bend, and then the road
is straight again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At mile four, the
shoulder is excellent, with room for two or possibly three bicyclists.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is an intersection at about 4.5
miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At this three-way stop, turn
right onto Highway 65.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After this, the
road is flat and has room for two cyclists on the shoulder.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>About half way through mile six, there is a
gentle curve and an uphill climb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then
it goes downhill, and there is a long curve right after that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the end of mile seven, there is a gradual
uphill climb and a sharp curve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Soon
after, the road flattens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At 8.7 miles,
the shoulder widens to fit three bicyclists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the middle of mile nine, there is a small bridge that can fit two
cyclists on the shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cyclists come
to an intersection at mile 9.5 and can turn around at the FINA Station.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cyclists should be especially careful of
mile 16 coming back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The road is extra
steep uphill with a downhill at the end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The shoulders are fair to excellent in most places, and cyclists only
have to be extremely careful in a few spots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>These two highways make a fantastic bike trail for almost any rider,
especially for one who is inexperienced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Cossman
Pass begins by the Pennzoil Gas Station next to scenic Toad Suck Park.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This trail goes left from that parking lot
on Highway 60 that, with the exception of a few poor bridges, has a good
shoulder for one bike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trail
follows 60 until it intersects with 113, where it goes toward Houston,
Arkansas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is the safest part of
the trip with not much traffic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After
seeing the numerous sites and attractions of Houston, the cyclist may take a
break at the abandoned Citgo gas station and pizza place.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After the break, the trail goes right (back
the way it came from before the break).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Then, it takes an almost immediate right to go south on Highway
216.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This leg of the trip is only for
the more experienced and adventurous riders, and if traffic is low, then the
cyclist might actually get out with only minimal scratches and bruises.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The shoulder is practically
nonexistent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trail turns left on
300 and heads for the exceedingly pleasant town of Pleasant Valley.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The shoulder is almost enough for a bike,
but the rider should be extremely wary of any traffic that could smoosh
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The shoulders in Bigelow increase
in width, making it a safe trail to follow back to the Pennzoil station.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The round trip is 32.3 miles long.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is mostly flat with a few hills.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This course is for those experienced riders
who do not mind dodging the occasional car.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">           </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The third route
begins at the Pennzoil gas station directly across from Toad Suck Park.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first leg of the trip is about ten miles
to Bigelow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The shoulder is good,
except for a few bridges where the shoulder is poor.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>There are a couple of sharp curves, but the terrain is mostly
flat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After Bigelow, the road shoulder
basically disappears and becomes poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>After Pleasant Valley, the trail evolves into a very curvy uphill.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Be careful; there is no shoulder, on the
left is a drop-off, and on the right is a cliff face.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The bicyclist then goes down the hill, maneuvering through some
extremely tight curves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At Wye, turn
left, and enjoy the scenery going toward Little Italy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The road has a poor shoulder and is extremely
hilly but straight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After passing
Little Italy, it gets curvy again with still many hills.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trail flattens out and then stays the
same past Pinnacle Mountain until Highway 10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The shoulder of Highway 10 is excellent for its first mile.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then, it degrades to good.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just stay on the shoulder, and everything
should be great; Highway 10 is a busy highway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Lake Maumelle is on the right for several miles.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The bicycle trail turns onto 113 and heads
back, uphill, to Wye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After reaching
Wye, the trail turns left and goes back through the first leg of the trip back
to Toad Suck Park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The entire round
trip is 68 miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This trail should
only be ridden by professionals willing to put their lives on the line.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">         </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The helicopter
zooms over the mountain, trying desperately to keep Gotta Mappa, younger
brother to the recently demised Noah Mappa, in sight of their curious
camera.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The crew can see the trail
snaking past hill after hill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Gotta
cruises dangerously fast on his Mongoose ten-speed road bike.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trees impede the vision of the
inquisitive camera crew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the ground,

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Only adrenaline is pushing him to keep on
going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A blind turn looms ahead.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A moment of panic passes through his blood,
but quickly subsides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He remembers the
map that he studied before he set out on his trek.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Wisely, he swerves to evade the 42.5 feet tall and 12 feet thick,
bloodstained, concrete wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Gotta
Mappa breathes a sigh of relief and continues on his journey to the finish
line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
