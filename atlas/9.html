<P>&#9;Arkansas’ population is constantly changing. There are many factors contributing to these changes including births, deaths, migration, and in-migration. Births contribute to the population because it adds new people into the world every day. Deaths offset births, because if there were only people being born and no people dying then the world would over populate. Migration also contributes to the population growth. Migration is   people moving into the country from outside of the country. In-migration is people moving from state to state and town to town inside the country. Between 1990 and 2000 the population of Arkansas is expected to increase by 4.2 percent, from 2,350,725 to 2,449,500 people (See Figure 1). By 2010 Arkansas is expected to have more than  2,547,800 people. The growth rate expectancy between 1990 and 2000 is much higher than that between 1980 and 1990, which was only 2.8 percent. The highest growth rate was between 1970 and 1980. It rose at an increase of 18.9 percent, from 1,923,322 to 2,286,357. Between 1960 and 1970 the population grew at a rate of 7.7 percent, and between 1940 and 1960 Arkansas’ population declined from 1,949,387 to 1,786,272. Two key factors contributing to Arkansas’ growth from 1990 to 2000 are the in-migration (U.S. citizens moving to Arkansas) of people ages sixty-five and older and the migration patterns found in Arkansas for people ages forty-five to sixty-four (IEA, A 1997). The in-migration of people ages sixty-five an older will grow five percent, from 348,000 to 366,700 between 1990 and 2000. Since the 1950s Arkansas has gained more in-migrants than it has lost. By 2010 Arkansans ages sixty-five and older will have reached 395,000. This is 16 percent of the total population in Arkansas. The in-migration of people ages forty-five to sixty-four is also gaining rather than losing. Because of the national baby boom, 1945 to 1964,  there will be a huge increase of people ages forty-five to sixty-four. Arkansas can expect to gain a large quantity of in-migrants in this age group in the twenty year span between 1990 and 2010. There is an expected increase of 23 percent in this age group from 1990 to 2000, going from 455,200 to 559,700. By 2010 Arkansas is expected to have 688,300 people ages forty-five to sixty-four (IEA, A 1997). This is 27 percent of the total population in Arkansas.</P>
<P>&#9;There are many other population trends that need to be looked at in Arkansas. The first is that Arkansans are becoming more middle-aged.  This is true across the entire United States because of the baby boom. &quot;The median age of the population is projected to reach 38 years by 2010, compared to 33.8  years in 1990&quot; (IEA, A 1997). By 2010 people ages sixty-five and older will probably account for around sixteen percent of Arkansas’ total population. This is about the same or lower than the other cohorts. The male growth population is also a growing trend. The number of males, in Arkansas, between 1990 and 2010 are projected to be higher than that of females. This is a reversal of past trends where the number of women grew faster than men. This will not be a great change in the sex ratio because in the past the number of women grew faster; therefore, all this will do is equal the ratio out. Another trend, which will remain the same, is the racial make up of Arkansas. Whites will continue to be about eighty-two percent of Arkansas’ population. Also more of the state’s population will live in fewer counties. There are eleven counties that make up Arkansas’ metropolitan areas. These eleven counties are projected to account for forty-nine percent of the state’s total population by 2010. That is half of the population in eleven out of the seventy-five counties in Arkansas (IEA, A). One of these eleven counties is Faulkner county. From 1992 to 1996 the total live births in Faulkner county were at an average of 959 per year. This is the second lowest county total in the state (County Trends 1992-1996, 66). The death rate in Faulkner county during this time was 489 per year. This probably ranks in the middle of the seventy-five counties (Mortality Statistics, 2-3). However, the population in Faulkner county is steadily growing. This is only partially due to births. The number of births has been increasing rapidly from 890 in 1992 to 1,040 in 1996, while the number of deaths is increasing slowly from 445 deaths in 1992 to 570 deaths in 1996.</P>
<P>&#9;In 1992 Faulkner county had 890 births and 445 deaths. There were also 248 induced abortions, which means there would have been 1,138 babies instead of 890. Using the birth and death rates of Faulkner county the population should have only grown by 445 people in 1993. The population actually grew by 2,422 people (See Figures 2 and 3). That means that 1,967 people in-migrated into this area from 1992 to 1993 (IEA, 1998). In 1993 Faulkner county had 892 live births, and the deaths rates raised to 470 in 1993. Faulkner counties population should have grown by only 422 people from 1993 to 1994, but it actually grew from 66,650 to 68,903. That is an increase of 2,253 people unaccounted for from birth and death rates; therefore,  they must be in-migrating (IEA, 1998). </P>
<P>&#9;In 1994 the total number of live births registered in Faulkner county was 937, and the total number of deaths registered was 475. This means that the birth rates and death rates for Faulkner county grew by 462 people. However Faulkner county actually grew by 2,361 people from 1994 to 1995. This tells us that around 1,899 people in-migrated into Faulkner county from 1994 to 1995. In 1995 1,038 live births and 525 deaths were accounted for in Faulkner county. By these numbers there should have been an increase of 513 people from 1995 to 1996. The population actually grew from 71,344 to 74,117 people in 1996. That leaves 2,773 people unaccounted for from births and deaths alone.  Faulkner county had 1,040 live births in 1996 and 570 deaths. By this count the population should have only increased by 510 people, but it actually grew by 2,478 people from 1996 to 1997. That means there were close to 1,968 people that in-migrated  to Faulkner county in 1996 (IEA, 1998). Figures 2 and 3 and the end of this report show these numbers in table and graph form.</P>
<P>&#9;The population of Faulkner county would be even higher if the induced abortions were stopped. Faulkner county ranks fourth in the state out of seventy-five counties in the induced abortion ratio from 1992-1996. The induced abortion ratio is the number of abortions compared to the number of live births in each county. The average ratio in Faulkner county from 1992-1996 was 21.4 (County Trends, 66). The total number of induced abortion was from 1992 to1996 was 1177 in Faulkner county. That is an average total average of 235 a year over this five year span (County Trends 1992-1996, 66). </P>
<P>&#9;The number of people that are not accounted for are assumed to have migrated in and may not be exact figures. No one really knows how many people migrate in each year. This is true for many reasons. One of the main reasons is because Faulkner county is the home to three different colleges. The college students that live in the dorms are not counted as part of the population. They are still counted where their parents live. Only college students with their own residents are counted in the population. This makes the population larger by far than it appears on paper or in a census. By taking the number of deaths and subtracting it from the total live births we have estimated roughly the number of in-migrants that move to Faulkner county each year, not counting college students. Another factor that could have effected the population growth is the general fertility rate. The General Fertility Rate is the birth rate of women age fifteen to forty-four.  The population of births to women less than age fifteen or more than age forty-four is not included in the general fertility rate.  These births represented about one-half to one percent of all births in Arkansas in 1996.  </P>
<P>&#9;The General Fertility Rate is calculated by dividing the total number of births in a given year by the number of women age fifteen to forty-four and multiplying by 1000.  The calculation of the general fertility rate is limited solely to live births. This does not include abortions, stillbirths, miscarriages, or pregnancy rate.  </P>
<P>&#9;Crude birth rate is another related statistic. This is the ratio of births to the total population. Crude birth rate is affected more by population differences in age and sex ratio. The crude birth rate is a better economic statistic than the general fertility rate.  </P>
<P>&#9; The average general fertility rate for Arkansas in 1992 through 1996 was sixty-eight percent. This rate has increased significantly to 70.8 percent since 1996. The highest fertility rates are in eastern Arkansas and in he counties along the western edge of the state. The Arkansas fertility rate has paralleled the Unites States fertility rate and they have both remained fairly constant since 1980 (County Trends 1992-1996, 4). The general fertility rate of Faulkner county averages at 53.9 from 1992 to 1996. This number two out of the seventy-five counties in Arkansas.</P>
<P>&#9;The Institute for Economic Advancement at UALR predicts that Faulkner county will continue to grow. They have estimated that in the year 2000 Faulkner county’s population will increase by11,342 people, and by 2005 there will be a total of 91,405 in Faulkner county. They are also estimating that the population in Faulkner county will have reached 103,050 by 2010 given existing trends. This would make Faulkner county the sixth largest county in the state (IEA, B 1997).</P>
<P>&#9;With Arkansas’ population steadily growing, the job, health, and other industries will also be growing. This means new opportunities opening up to the future generations entering the job force. This will be needed in order to support the older generations that are continuously rising in number, because of new medical technologies. Faulkner county’s population is no exception to this rise. The births will continue to rise, while the deaths decrease some, and migration and in-migration will continue to add growth to the population. This will not be an unexpected surprise to the people here, because the population has been on a steady incline for years, and it will continue on this incline for years to come. </P>
