	During the centuries following the creation of the world, people have lived in 



coordination with the nature , respecting her as she fed them and fearing her as she 




showed her strength.




With the coming of the industrial revolution, man was more interested in developing new




techniques of production and in increasing his productivity than in preserving the nature.




Thus by the middle of the twentieth century, man had been responsible for serious 




environmental disasters, many of which are considered irreversible.


At the end of the century, however, man has become conscious of the environmental 

problems as the hole of the ozone layer, the global warming of the planet, pollution, etc. 
But the problems are also important at a minor scale since today, each city, no matter 
How small it is, has to face ecological problems due to the urbanization. Indeed, some 
animals and plant species are disappearing and pollution begins to occur also in the small 
cities.

<H3>First, we are going to explain what&#146;s an ecosystem as it is the key-word that resumes  
</H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 100%"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>all the
environmental matters. This first part will then help us focus on the
Conway&#146;s ecosystem and we will try to find out whether this
small city suffers from ecological problems or not. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	In our
textbook, an ecosystem is defined as &#147; an interrelated
collection of plants and animals and the physical environment with
which they interact &#148; ( Bergman, Renwick 1999: 137). The
ecosystem is composed of many necessary elements ( Bergman, Renwick
1999: 137 ). It contains many organisms that have a complex pattern 
of interdependence and interaction with one another and with their
environment  ( International Congress of Ecology 1974: 120 ). The
green plants which are the producers of food use photosynthesis to
make their own food and provide food to the consumers that eat the
plants. The animals that eat the producers and other animals are the
consumers of food. When a plant or animal dies, the decomposers, such
as bacteria, fungus, insects, and worms, come in, digest and then
recycle the remains ( Bergman, Renwick 1999: 137 ). There are also
the materials and energy that are necessary for all of this to occur.
These include oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, mineral nutrients, and
energy such as heat and light ( Bergman, Renwick 1999: 138 ).
Ecosystems are energy processing units, but are constrained by the
availability of water and other essential nutrients. Energy fuels all
of the processes in an ecosystem but the speed at which they occur
depends on nutrient availability ( International Congress of Ecology
1974: 11 ). Therefore, all of these elements must be present  for the
ecosystem to function as a whole. It is necessary for all of these to
be present to have a complete ecosystem that carries out all of its
processes.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	The sun
begins the processes of the ecosystem by providing the green plants
with the ability to produce carbohydrates which are used as food.
This begins the process known as the food chain. The green plants
supply the plant-eating animals known as herbivores with food that is
stored in the plants. Meat-eating animals known as carnivores then
eat the herbivores. The herbivores and carnivores may then be eaten
by omnivores which eat both plants and animals. We, humans, are an
example of an omnivore. Although much of the food consumed by animals
used to keep their bodies functioning correctly, the animals do
excrete some of the food as waste and their bodies are also full of
stored nutrients when the animal dies. Small organisms, we call
decomposers, feed on these excretions and the animals&#146; bodies
when they die. The decomposers return the nutrients to the soil and
to the atmosphere which competes the cycle ( Bergman, Renwick 1999:
138 ).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	Another
process in the ecosystem is the adaptation of plants to their
surroundings. Plants are in constant competition with one another for
things such as space, light, water and nutrients. Plants do need all
of these things to grow. However, at least one of these is usually
restricted which in turn forces competition within the ecosystem and
adaptation to the surrounding area. In different environments the
plants will compete for different things. For example, an area with
an adequate supply of water and sunlight may have poor soil.
Therefore, the plants should have to compete for the small amount of
nutrients in the soil. The plants that have adapted the
characteristics and mechanisms to succeed in their environment
through evolution have survived. The plants that compete best will be
the dominant force in their environment ( Bergman, Renwick 1999: 140
).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	Man&#146;s
role in an ecosystem can be both good and bad. Air pollution
definitely has a negative effect on ecosystems. The rising amounts of
air pollution are causing changes in the structure of natural
ecosystems and the functions that the ecosystems carry out </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>( Matthews,
Smith, Goldberg 1971:47 ). The effect of air pollution on crop plants
can cause great agricultural loss and the effect on trees can range
from leaf damage to changes in regional climates ( Matthews, Smith,
and Goldberg 1971:99 ). Air pollution&#146;s effect  on crop plants
causes an estimated loss of $ 500 million dollars annually. Most of
this loss is due to the suppression of growth or chronic injury to
plants due to the pollution problem ( Matthews, Smith, Goldberg 1971:
101 ). The main  damage to forest and shade trees is a result of
stack gas from coal-burning power plants and from toxicant in urban
smog. Where thousands of acres of trees are killed out around a
smelter, the area&#146;s climate is altered adversely. Trees help to
screen out  polluting industries and if they are used wisely can help
with the struggle against air pollution ( Matthews, Smith, Goldberg
1971: 116 ). However, just one fifth of the world&#146;s original
forests remain and the cutting and burning of these forests is
increasing. By devastating these ecosystems, we are also losing many
species of animals and many important resources. Road building and
other infrastructure developments are quickly proceeding globally.
Population pressure and loss of land in some parts of the world will
cause even more of the only remaining forests we have to be altered
by migration of humans to these locations ( Bryant, Nielsen, Tangley
1997: 5 ). The major threats to the ecosystems today include the
logging industry, new infrastructures used for mining and energy
development, land clearing for agriculture, over hunting, etc. In
many cases, the forests are endangered by more than one of these (
Bryant, Nielsen, Tangley 1997: 15,16 ). There are efforts by humans
now to stop the destruction of forests and to stop pollution, but
what they are fighting are examples of man&#146;s disregard for
natural habitat and the ecosystems of the world. Much of the world is
being urbanized by humans which constantly disturbs the few natural
ecosystems we have left. For thousands of years now the ecosystems
have been constantly disrupted ( Bergman, Renwick 1999: 151 ). Humans
have unbalanced the ecosystems and have made them less natural.
Distribution of biomes have been altered and many ecosystems are
close to elimination if not already eliminated  ( Bergman, Renwick
1999: 151 ). For ecosystems that have been eliminated there is still
hope for a return to a flourishing environment, but not much.
Mainstream science is now accepting ecological restoration as a new
developing field. Meetings are held to promote and discuss this
restoration process. However, the success is often inadequate because
of natural reoccurring events such as droughts, floods and
hurricanes. For example, in the process of restoring a wetland, a
drought can occur that will eliminate all recovery process that is
made. This discourages society from investing further funds into the
effort</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>to restore
the wetlands ( Cairns 1995: 9 ). A few thousand years ago, Earth
regulated itself and humans were no different from any other common
species. There was no human destruction of habitat and therefore, no
need for restoration. Today, humans dominate the Earth&#146;s
environmental processes and have a major effect on the ecosystems of
the world. The future of the Earth is uncertain. It will depend on
humans and the ways  that we manipulate the surface of the Earth.
However, human impact doesn&#146;t look good for ecosystems right now
as the natural ecosystems in which humans have a small impact are
becoming increasingly small and the future of these natural
ecosystems is looking dark ( Bergman, Renwick 1999: 151,152 ). But
what about Conway&#146;s ecosystem?</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>	Conway is
located in Faulkner County approximately thirty  miles northwest of
Little Rock at the intersection of interstate 40 and U.S. highways 64
and 65. It is located alongside the Arkansas River.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>	Conway,
the county seat, was settled in 1871, and incorporated to the
Faulkner County as a town October 9<SUP>th</SUP> 1878. At that time ,
it contained a population of 1500 so it was a village rather than a
city. But today, Conway&#146;s landscape is no longer formed by land
and farms. Indeed, according to the 1998 U.S. census data, Conway is
now the eighth largest city in Arkansas. In eight years, Conway&#146;s
population grew from 12,683 in 1990 to 40,000 in 1998. Conway is
growing so fast that according to Bill Hegeman &#150; the general
manager of the city-owned utility provider &#150; &#147; by 2020
Conway should be competing well with North Little Rock for the rank
of the second largest Arkansas city &#148; </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>(

).The first document shows the evolution of  Conway&#146;s population
and the evolution of the Faulkner County population. This chart shows
the growing importance of Conway in the Faulkner County. Indeed,
Conway&#146;s population estimate for the year 2010 will almost
represent the half of the county&#146;s population. And as you can
see on the fourth document, a street plan, in order to make a  proper
zoning, is conceived with every major growth of the population.     </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>	The
growth of the population is followed by the expansion of the
enterprises, a fact that convinces people either to move in to Conway
or to commute since more jobs will be provided and the activity will
boom. During the past twenty years, the employment has nearly
tripled. The number of manufacturing jobs grew from 1,291 in 1959 to
7,302 in 1996. Besides, according to Bill Hegeman, Conway has been
the first small city in Arkansas to develop the idea for an
industrial park. The Conway development corporation originally
acquired 174 acres of land in 1962 south of the city near the
airport. In 1965, the corporation purchased an additional 140 acres
and in 1976, they acquired 160 acres of land east of Interstate  40.
According to Conway Area Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Lloyd
Westbrook: &#147; we&#146;ve got a lot of industry for a town this
size &#148; (
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.thecabin.net/stories/070199/loc_0607990003.html">http://www.thecabin.net/stories/070199/loc_0607990003.html</A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>According to
Alderman Andy Hawkins, the city council&#146;s liaison to the
planning commission: &#147; if you just see the number of cars on the
road and the number of houses being built, you know there&#146;s been
growth &#148;. Indeed, as shows the second document, the number of
building permits issued and family units constructed in Conway grew
from 322 in 1990 to 817 in 1998. And as far as the number of vehicles
sold is concerned, it increased by 1.9 % between 1994 and 1998 (
document 5 ). Well, this growth has many consequences on Conway&#146;s
ecosystem ( fauna, flora ).</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>
The first consequence appears on the third document, as the city
grows it annexes more and more areas. In other words, as the city
grows we have to burn more land and cut more forests. But the story
doesn&#146;t end here, indeed, a city needs roads, adequate
infrastructures, water and wastewater capabilities, access to major
highways and rail lines, etc. Thus, not only we will increase the
number of flooding homes and businesses due to an abundance of more
concrete and asphalt but we are also going to increase the air
pollution. Indeed, each one of us breathes about 3,400 gallons of air
every day. Yet, daily our air is contaminated by human activities
such as driving cars, burning fossil fuels and manufacturing
chemicals ( see document 6 which deals with the air pollutants
emissions for Faulkner County, or
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.tree2.epa.gov/CEIS/CEIS.nsf/$$All/0505045AIR">http://www.tree2.epa.gov/CEIS/CEIS.nsf/$$All/0505045AIR</A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
) . Because of its rapid growth, today Conway is concerned with water
and energy misuse and land abuse; for example in July 1999, the
council approved a water conservation plan. That means that residents
will be ask to &#147; voluntarily curtail their water usage by
irrigation only every other day &#148; and business and industry will
be asked &#147; to reduce water consumption &#148; (
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.thecabin.net/stories/072899/con_0728990019.html">http://www.thecabin.net/stories/072899/con_0728990019.html</A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>The
fauna is also altered by the growth of Conway as it threatens the
species living around its area as well as in the city. Indeed, how
many times have you seen dead animals on the shoulders of the roads (
like squirrels ) ? I&#146;m sure that you can&#146;t even remember as
there are so many of them killed every day! As far as deer are
concerned, their population in Arkansas has increased dramatically in
the past 30 years. The problem is that the city is taking their
territory and according to Dr. Philip Tappe &#150; a professor of
wildlife ecology and management &#150; &#147; what we&#146;re seeing
in urbanization moving into areas where the deer are increasing and
the number of hunters is either stable or decreasing. Deer
populations and human populations are starting to collide &#148; (
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.thecabin.net/stories/112797/new_citydeer.html">http://www.thecabin.net/stories/112797/new_citydeer.html</A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
). As deer are eating their bushes or trampling their properties, the
residents are upset, but what they don&#146;t think about is that man
has taken the deer&#146;s habitat and that they have no right to be
upset or to ask the city to allow more hunting!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>As
the nickname, the natural state, implies more than half of Arkansas
is covered by forests and water, Arkansas is host to a thriving &#147;
eco-tourism &#148; market. But by expanding our cities, aren&#146;t
we destroying this source of revenue?</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3><U>Conclusion:</U></FONT></P>
<P>	As mentioned earlier in the introduction, all of the elements in
the ecosystem must be present and held in check in order for the
ecosystem to function properly. Since most of Conway&#146;s growth
has occurred within the present decade it is hard to examine the full
extent of damage done to the environment and these elements. Yet, as
indicated by our charts, Conway has no indication of doing nothing
but expanding even more rapidly in the coming years. Consequently,
negative effects due to industrialization and pollution  created by
expansion are sure to come. More industrialization, commuting to
industrialization, and an increasing population have all contributed
to the rapid urbanization of Conway negatively effecting its
ecosystem. Yet, there has been an overwhelming lack of concern for
the environment which has created a lack of research on the effects
simply because few people have cared to research it.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">The rapid sprawl of urbanization from
Little Rock has drawn little attention from the Conway community and
other communities as well, as far as the welfare of its natural
environment is concerned. Action for Conway&#146;s Tomorrow ( ACT )
is currently trying to guide the dramatic growth of Conway. Many
participants in this organization are concerned with the development
of a &#147; family friendly city &#148; consisting of more parks,
sidewalks, bicycle paths, youth and education centers (
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.htecabin.net/stories/071399/act_073990004.html">http://www.htecabin.net/stories/071399/act_073990004.html</A></U></FONT>
) which could definitely present some potential positives. Yet, what
about the concern of an &#147; environmentally friendly city &#148;?</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Conway&#146;s urbanization fragments
landscapes disrupts wildlife habitats, alters rivers and streams and
increases pollution ( Newsweek, July 19, 1999: 25 ). Considering that
Conway is the fastest growing city in Arkansas, there needs to be
more environmentally educated representatives of a growth management
team for this city. We can only conclude that the cities planning
commission is more concerned with the city&#146;s image and its
revenue capacity. Yet it is hard to expect a more environmentally
aware representation if Little Rock&#146;s planning team can&#146;t
even get off on the right foot. The Little Rock Planning Commission
proposed a resolution which would have donated $ 250,000 to $ 300,000
to extend the smart growth process for up to eighteenth months. This
would help the commission to provide more ways to protect the
environment by giving them more time to create a course of action (
Arkansas Democrat Gazette 1999 : 3b ). Agreement was inconclusive and
still remains in limbo. Yes indeed, it is even harder for Conway to
focus on an environmentally safe city if big brother cannot even get
its act together.</P>
