<P ALIGN=LEFT>How Has the Population Changed in the State of
Arkansas, Faulkner County, and the City of Conway, in the last 20
years?</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><IMG SRC="sv4k24k3.jpg" NAME="G1: arpop" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=297 HEIGHT=235 BORDER=0>A
population is defined as a group of like objects or organisms.   For
us, it is more than the number of people around us; it is the
information that they carry.  People are different in many ways.   A
person&#146;s race, religion, economic welfare, and how far they
travel to work all make up the demographics of a group.  By using
this information that is collected by the governmental census every
10 years and in-between by independent research groups, you can get
an accurate idea of where the population is and what it is composed
of.  By analyzing this data, major decisions can be made, such as
school placement, voting districts and other social benefits.  
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">Arkansas&#146;
population has gone up slightly in recent decades.  The projected
population of Arkansas for 2025 is 3,687,000.  Its rate of increase
from 1960-2000 is approximately 50 percent, and Arkansas ranks 23 in
largest population rate increase during that period (Federation for
American Immigration Reform web site).  The current trend in
population shift is to the south and west, with the Northeast and
Midwest decreasing in population (US Global Change Research
Information Office web site). 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><IMG SRC="sv4k24k4.jpg" NAME="G2: tab1-4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=214 HEIGHT=241 BORDER=0>As
you can see, the population shift is moving in our direction, and is
approaching rapidly.  With a larger population come some problems,
such as traffic congestion, fire, and sewer resources being stretched
too thin.    The city planning committee has already proposed a plan
to help the growth of Conway, which is projected to reach a
population of 63,000 by 2010, see inset, (Conway Planning Department
web site).  
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 200%"><IMG SRC="sv4k24k5.jpg" NAME="G3: Image2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=253 HEIGHT=270 BORDER=0>Several
of the things that the city has planned for, are for the roads to be
replaced and redesigned 
(<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.conwayplanning.org/Street/Trffc2k.pdf">http://www.conwayplanning.org/Street/Trffc2k.pdf</A></U></FONT>)
and fire stations and sewer lines being added
(<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.conwayplanning.org/Growth/Image6.jpg">http://www.conwayplanning.org/Growth/Image6.jpg</A></U></FONT>).
 There is currently a proposal for a western loop to run from 1-40,
curve NW, and then run parallel to the Arkansas River
(<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.conwayplanning.org/Loop/Loop.html">http://www.conwayplanning.org/Loop/Loop.html</A></U></FONT>).
 This loop would help the expanding population of west Conway to
travel to and from I-40 without having to go through central Conway. 
Dealing with the rush of commuters in their day-to-day tasks is a lot
like dealing with the current trend in immigration by Hispanics. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">So what
is Hispanic?  Before you can answer that question, you have to look
at what makes up a &quot;race&quot; versus an &quot;ethnic group.&quot;
 A race of people is one of the same skin color.  The White race is
one of light skin, of European origin.  They are scattered across the
world, so there is not one home or region that White people live. 
The same applies to the Black race.  On the other hand, the term
Asian is used in the census as a racial group.  What is Asian?  Are
people from Southeast Asia, such as Korea or Japan, or is it someone
from Mongolia, India, or Western Russia?  They all technically live
in Asia, but we do not think of them all as Asian.  In performing a
population count, we tend to classify people by where they are from,
or what their background is most like, using politically correct
terms. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">The
Hispanic or Latino population is considered by the US Census
department as &quot;A self-designated classification for people whose
origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or
South America, the Caribbean, or those identifying themselves
generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, etc.&quot;  They go on to say
that the &quot;Spanish/Hispanic/Latino people may be of any race.&quot;
 One major aspect of racial population shift is the Hispanic
population increase in the US.  The current growth state of the
Mexican population is pushing more Hispanic people into the US,
primarily in the West and South, as stated above.  Mexico has an
estimated 100,349,766 people as of July 2000, and has a net migration
rate of -2.84 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2000 estimate)
(<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/mx.html">http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/mx.html</A></U></FONT>.)
 Net migration rate is; those who moved IN minus those who moved OUT
divided by the midyear population times 1000.  This means that almost
3 out every 1000 Mexican people leave their country per year, on
average, meaning approx 284,993 per year com into the United States!</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><IMG SRC="sv4k24k6.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>This
issue was only brought up in this current census, which county data
will be available the summer for 2001, and expanded data being
released in 2002.  At its current rate, the Hispanic population will
take over the Black population as the new minority by 2005, Hispanic
having 12.6% of the total U.S. population (Benton Foundation web
site).  Also, by 2050, 25% of Americans will be Hispanic, leaving
only 53% of the population classified as white, which is a great
shift in the majority.  The rate of foreign-born immigrants in the US
has gone up 288 percent since 1960, and Arkansas ranks 10<SUP>th</SUP>
with a 560% increase with 41,700 people.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><IMG SRC="sv4k24k7.gif" NAME="Object1" ALIGN=LEFT>It
is difficult to say if Faulkner County's population saw an increase
in Hispanic because in the 1990 Census, the choices were, White,
Black, American Indian, Asian, or Other.  The Other category is only
claiming 102 out of 60,006 people for the county.  In the 1980
Census, there was 90 out of 46,192.

can see, the minority population in Faulkner County is increasing
with every decade, but not nearly as fast as the total population of
the county.  The country as a whole is going to have to learn to deal
with an ever-expanding population size and diversity.</P>
