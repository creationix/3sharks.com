<P>Where did the Blues originate?  How and where did they go from there and where are the Blues today?</P>

<P>&#9;While attending a school function recently, it became apparent that the Blues have arrived in even the smallest of central Arkansas towns.  The occasion was the opening of the new auditorium at Beebe which had been destroyed ten months earlier by a category F-3 tornado. The entire community turned out to hear the choral groups, teachers, and other local talents perform.  A fifteen - year old girl from the area did several numbers, and two of those were Blues numbers.  It is amazing to think about the distance the Blues have traveled to get where they are today.  Originating in the fields with the slaves, the Blues movement began over two- hundred years ago.  The music and words, which are the essence of all that is Blue, have influenced almost every type of music listened to today.  To think of a young white girl from a tiny town in central Arkansas standing on a stage playing a saxophone and belting out the Blues to the accompaniment of hundreds of clapping hands is phenomenal.  Not only is this a sign of the geographic distance the Blues have traveled, but also the cultural distance.  Once considered &quot; Black&quot; music, we can see today that just as our society it is no longer divided by color, neither is the Blues.  This is a measure of how quickly an influence such as the Blues can travel, be shared by people in all walks of life, and continue to influence others in their musical endeavors.</P>
<P>&#9;Ralph Ellison once said, &quot;The Blues is an impulse to keep the painful details and episodes of a brutal experience alive in one’s aching consciousness, to finger its jagged grain, and to transcend it, not by the consolation of philosophy but by squeezing from it a near-tragic, near-comic lyricism.  As a form, the Blues is an autobiographical chronicle of personal catastrophe expressed lyrically...they at once express both the agony of life and the possibility of conquering it through sheer toughness of spirit.  They fall short of tragedy only in that they provide no solution, offer no scapegoat but the self.&quot;  (Ellison, http://afgen.com/bluslink.html)  Ellison puts all that is the Blues into an eloquent and moving passage which captures the heart and soul of a music that has touched us all at one time or another.  Every person can probably find a moment in their lives when some form of  music helped them to get through a rough time, or how another’s lyrics helped them to express their own feelings.  Rock n’ Roll may be one’s favorite form of music, but without the influence of  the Blues, the Rock n’ Roll movement would have had a much harder time getting started.  Jazz, Gospel, and Soul were all influenced greatly by the Blues.  The Blues are not meant to be necessarily &quot;depressing or sad&quot; , but rather it is to be considered soulful with the words telling a story about the loss or misfortune of another person.  It is &quot;a complex combination of misery and high spirits.&quot;  The music, which accompanies these lyrics, is contradictory because it is often joyous, with a feeling of arrogance stemming from it that is a contrast to the unhappiness of its written message.  This creates an ambiguity that is fascinating and has much to do with the Blue’s appeal universally (Green, http://afgen.com/aboutblu.html).</P>
<P>&#9;While it has always been thought that the Blues originated in Africa, facts prove that it actually began in the Mississippi Delta.  After the slaves were brought from Africa into Virginia in 1619, they were transported to other areas of the United States.  Most of the slaves were sold in the southern states because cotton was so important to the south’s economy.  This is why so much of the early music came from this geographical region (Roach p 4).   The African roots were the source of the holler that the slaves used while toiling in the fields of southern slave - owners.  This &quot;holler&quot; is a loud cry rising and falling in falsetto.  The chanting was a wild yell with neither harmony or softness.  It was instead a pitiful mourning cry filled with sorrow and pain (Davis, p 33).  In the fields, the slaves sang songs in order to assure their masters that they were not planning an uprising.  The music helped them to share their burden with other slaves and acted as a form of amusement to them. They communicated their emotions to the other slaves by using this holler or chant.  Their creativity with these hollers, spirituals and work songs  was remembrances of their homeland (Roach p 4-5).</P>
<P>&#9;One of the problems with defining the Blues is the variety of authoritative opinions.  Most musicologists maintain that the Blues are defined by the use of &quot;blue notes&quot;(Tanner p 35).  These notes were used to show the sadness and &quot;mournful qualities.  These are defined ass &quot;chromatic-like or semi-tone waverings between major and minor thirds.&quot;  The &quot;Blue notes&quot; were a derivation of the &quot;African scales and vocal approximations&quot; and was a distinctive trait &quot;inherent in the language and the ornamented melodic lines&quot; (Roach p 71).  Some feel that the song form is the defining nature of the Blues, while others feel that the Blues is a way to approach music, or a philosophy, in a manner of speaking.  Still, others hold a much wider sociological view that the blues are an entire musical tradition rooted in the black experience of the post-war South.  Regardless of what one thinks, &quot;the social implications of the blues, whether it expresses the American or black experience in microcosm, it is the strong autobiographical nature, the intense personal passion, chaos and loneliness that is executed so vibrantly that it captures the imagination of modern musicians and the general public as well, not just at its point of origin, but all over the world &quot; (Shapiro p 13).</P>
<P>&#9;After developing in the cotton fields, The Blues started its commercial travel after the Civil War.  Blacks settled in an area of Dallas, Texas located near the train depot.  This area was known as &quot;Central tracks.&quot;  It was one of the many towns created throughout the country by the freed slaves who were looking for a place to call their own.  This area was located primarily on Elm Street, but as a result of the dialect of the early settlers &quot;Elm&quot; was pronounced with two syllables, &quot;El-Lum.&quot;  Thus, the name &quot;Deep Ellum&quot; was then created.  &quot;Deep Ellum was a little bit Harlem, a little bit Bourbon Street, a safe haven for a number of Jews and a place where everyone who did not &quot;fit in&quot; anywhere else could belong.&quot;  Deep Ellum was truly an institution and the perfect place for the birth of the commercial Blues (www.bluecatblues.com/history.htm).  </P>
<P>&#9;Songs which can be classified as the first Blues songs soon started to be written and published.  Some &quot;Bluesologists&quot; claim that the first Blues song ever written down was &quot;Dallas Blues&quot; which was published in 1912 by Hart Wand, a white violinist from Oklahoma City (Tanner p 40).  However, others disagree.  W.C. Handy also had a Blues song published in 1912.  His story is quite interesting.  Handy began listening to the &quot;Folk Blues&quot; in Clarksdale Mississippi.  He heard Negroes hollering and wailing in the fields during the day and in the evenings from their porches.  Although at this time Handy had already been trained in the classical music field, he was still drawn to the rhythmic chanting of this primitive sound (Dickerson p 21).  After moving to Memphis in1905, Handy was mesmerized by the lights and action of Beale Street.  During this time, Beale Street was &quot;the most prominent gathering place for Blacks in the nation.&quot;  It was also an area that did not have racial segregation.  He soon became acquainted with Memphis politician, E.H. Crump and their friendship would eventually alter the course of history for American Music.  Handy wrote a song for Crump’s campaign which combined &quot;the emotional appeal of the primitive music of the Delta&quot; with his classical music found in orchestra music.  The final product had the rhythm of Africa combined with &quot;European instrumentation.&quot;  This song originally titled &quot;Mister Crump&quot; later became known as &quot;The Memphis Blues.&quot;  This is the song which went on sale as sheet  music in 1912 (Dickerson p 25).  Whatever one chooses to believe we still know &quot;the poetic and musical form of the Blues first crystallized around 1910 and gained popularity through the publication of Handy’s &quot;Memphis Blues&quot; in 1912 and &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; in 1914.  The Blues were gaining more and more popularity&quot; (Kamien p 518).</P>
<P>&#9;The way the Blues spread within the United States is nothing short of spectacular.  Although popular in the South and the Mississippi Delta, during the early 1900’s people still erected barriers between one another, even in the same country.  Relocation diffusion, which contributes to the spread of ideas from one point to another, had occurred earlier when the roots of this music were brought from Africa by the slaves.  This sound developed in the steamy Southern cotton fields and originally was only popular in that region.  Two external factors influenced the further transportation of the Blues in North America.  After World War I, North American troops returned home with a new type of music, the Blues.  Of course, they did not gain this from the Europeans but rather from Southern whites who had been exposed to the Blues before the war.  The Blues were off to a good start and during the twenties the Blues became a national craze.  Billie Holliday and Bessie Smith were both instrumental in the spread of the Blues in the twenties and thirties and the records they made sold millions. (Kamien p 518).  The other factor responsible for the spread of the Blues in the United States was the migration of a large number of blacks northward during the thirties and forties.  Large numbers of Blacks made their way to the North in search of a better life, which they thought attainable because of the technological opportunities that could be found in the North as well as the opportunities that could be found artistically.  The Blues followed the Blacks just like the &quot;spirituals followed the slaves to the plantation.&quot; (Roach p 46). The Blues now entered into the repertoire of big-band jazz.  The Blues also took on an electrified edge with the introduction of the amplified guitar.  &quot;In some Northern cities like Chicago and Detroit, during the late forties and fifties, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, John Lee Hooker, Howlin’ Wolf, and Elmore James among others, played what was basically Mississippi Delta Blues, backed by bass, drums, piano and occasionally harmonica.&quot;  Soon they were scoring national hits with their Blues music.  Around the same time, T-Bone Walker in Houston and B.B. King in Memphis were pioneering a style of guitar playing that combined Jazz technique with the Blues tonality and repertoire (RSR&amp;RE p 53).  </P>
<P>&#9;The diffusion of the Blues world - wide took place in the late eighteen hundreds when Black students from Nashville’s Fisk University were asked to form a choir for a fund-raising tour.  During the subsequent tours of the U.S. and Europe, it was the pre-abolition plantation songs that captured the attention of the mostly white audiences.  The music, however, was made less offensive by choir directors, whose musical backgrounds and training were European.  These &quot;spirituals&quot; became an entertainment for audiences that had little interest in the powerful theology of liberation, though since then, spirituals have inspired musicians around the world, and have been re-absorbed by Black Gospel singers.  </P>
<P>&#9;In the early nineteen - sixties, young White American and European musicians began to discover the urban Blues.  These Blues-based bands like the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers, Cream, Canned Heat, and Fleetwood Mac brought the Blues to young White audiences.  This was something the Black Blues artists had been unable to do in America, except through the stolen White cross - overs covers of Black Rhythm and Blues songs.  Since the sixties, Rock music has undergone several Blues revivals.  &quot;Some Rock guitarists, such as Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, and Eddie Van Halen, have used the Blues as a foundation for legendary styles, while the originators like John Lee Hooker, Albert Collins, and B.B. King and their heirs, Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, and the late Roy Buchanan, among many others, continued to make fantastic music in the Blues tradition which has been highly appreciated all over the world.&quot;  The latest generation of Blues players like Robert Cray and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan have followed the Blues tradition and graced it with their incredible technicality. Their contributions have drawn a new generation of listeners to the Blues all over the world (Davis).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Blues as we know them today is the result of many things.  The slaves who began their mournful hollering as a way to express themselves led to the spread of this sound all the way from the cotton fields of the South, to the &quot;Freedmanstown&quot; in the Dallas area, to Memphis, to the northern cities of Chicago and Detroit, and eventually to Europe and back with the soldiers of World War I.  Beginning as a predominantly Black music form, it has evolved into every area of music available to music lovers today.  It still continues to influence new performers in their musical endeavors.  Despite the barriers of slavery, race, and the difficulty of travel during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the music which captured the tragedy’s and everyday occurrences of the past has stood strong and proud.  Its style and essence is central to this country’s heritage and continues to tell a story of the past while embracing the future at the same time.</P>
