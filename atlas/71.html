<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">	Air
pollution is a major problem, even in the Natural State.  It is
defined as any substance that contaminates our air and affects its
composition.  Polluted air can contain dust and chemicals such as
naturally produced carbon monoxide, chimney smoke, and green house
gases emitted from car exhaust.  When the air is not clean, the
entire environment is affected because both plants and animals depend
on air to breathe.  Trees, lakes, and animals have been harmed by air
pollution.  Air pollutants have thinned the protective ozone layer, a
layer of ozone molecules (O3) in the upper atmosphere that screen out
ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun.  This loss of ozone could cause
changes in the environment.(2)  Air pollution has many harmful
effects on humans as well.  It can cause burning in the eyes and nose
and an irritated throat.  Some chemicals found in polluted air cause
cancer, birth defects, brain and nerve damage and long-term injury to
the lungs and breathing passages.  Also air pollution can damage
property.  Some common pollutants eat away stone, damaging buildings,
monuments and statues.  Overall, air pollution is a major issue that
effects the world in many ways. </FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">It
is important for us to understand that unlike other types of
pollution, air pollution is not stopped by political boundaries.  To
use the old clich&eacute;, it is &#147;as free to move about as the
wind&#148;.  The striking fact is that this is all too true. 
Pollutants emitted in Arkansas can travel with the wind patterns and
jet streams to other locations, corrupting the quality of air &#147;where
ever the wind may take it.&#148;   The following picture shows how
pollutants are transferred from water to land and vice versa. 
Repeated cycles of transport, deposition, and evaporation can move
toxic pollutants very long distances.</FONT></P>

The most tangible result of air pollution is the green house effect. 
The green house effect is a naturally occurring process that aids in
heating the Earth's surface and atmosphere.  It results from the fact
that certain atmospheric gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane,
are able to change the energy balance of the planet by being able to
absorb long wave radiation from the Earth's surface.  But if the
gases in this process are over-emitted then the Earth&#146;s
temperature could rise to dangerous levels.  There are several common
types of air pollutants, some more dangerous than others.  Here are a
few examples of air pollutants in Arkansas that are of concern.

All VOCs contain carbon (C), the basic chemical element found in
living beings. Carbon-containing chemicals are called organic.
Volatile chemicals escape into the air easily. Many VOCs, such as the
chemicals listed in the table, are also hazardous air pollutants,
which can cause very serious illnesses. EPA does not list VOCs as
criteria air pollutants, but they are included in this list of

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">One specific case in which the
Clean Air Act was violated was in a bakery in San Francisco,
California.  On September 12, 2000 the Arkansas based Meyer&#146;s
Bakery  agreed to pay the 3.5 million dollars to settle the charges
brought against it.  The director of the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) for the Southwest region said that the reason for taking
these precautions is to protect human health and ensure compliance
with the Clean Air Act.  The bakery was releasing thousands of pounds
of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) through appliance leaks that had not
been repaired.  Chlorofluorocarbons are carbon compounds that contain
chlorine and fluorine.  Some examples of products containing CFCs are
hair sprays, paints, foam plastic products, and carburetor and choke
sprays, all of which are consumer related.  CFCs contribute to the
greenhouse effect in the lower atmosphere and then diffuse into the
stratosphere where they are broken down by ultraviolet radiation. 
The bakery was not conducting leak checks and the service records
were not completed.  They also did not have a replacement plan for
the leaking systems. (1)</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Another recent case was the
lawsuit against Williamette Industries and was the largest penalty
ever assessed for factory emissions of air pollution.  The fine was
$11.2 million, and the company was also required to spend an
additional $8 million on environmental projects.  The allegation made
against Williamette Industries was that it failed to control the
amount of air pollution released from its wood product factories in
four states.  The statement was issued by the EPA and the United
States Justice Department.  The Attorney General commented that the
settlement would improve air quality for thousands of people who live
around the factories and prevent them from becoming a health risk to
the citizens. (6)</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Lately, the government has done a
good job on lowering the amount of pollutants that are released into
the atmosphere.  With more and more cases of mishandling the waste of
many products and not controlling the amount of agriculture, the
environment itself is heading for a major down fall.  </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Solving the problems of air
pollution is not a simple task.  It requires not only the
participation of the government but also the consumers.  Businesses,
communities, and other groups have been working together in an effort
to save the atmosphere.  These groups are mainly focused on the small
things that can help in larger ways.  Industries can reduce the
amount of the pollution that is being produced by installing more
sufficient filters and using fuels that burn cleaner.  It is even
encouraged for cars to get a regular tune-up so that they will run
cleaner and in produce less carbon monoxide.  With all of the many
solutions that are possible, Arkansas facilities are more prepared
for pollution in the air.  This is all possible because Arkansas has
maintained a more comprehensive permitting program than other states.
 Some steps are being made to reduce the amount of pollutants in the
air but nothing drastic is being made.  The Clean Air Act is doing
what little it can but it still isn&#146;t stopping the major air
problems in Arkansas.  A great solution would be to require vehicle
inspections on all vehicles.  That would lower the amount of carbon
monoxide from cars greatly.  Consumers should also cut back on the
everyday items we use that contain pollutants.  We should be
concerned about the quality of the air in Arkansas not only for the
present population, but for the future.  Let&#146;s start ending air
pollution now, before it&#146;s too late.  Let&#146;s help keep
Arkansas air clean!</FONT></P>
