What are the formations, types, damages, and paths of tornadoes in Arkansas?
</h3></center>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	A tornado drops from the sky
and suddenly lives are torn apart.  Trees rip from the earth with
ease.  Houses turn upside down within seconds!  Hopes and futures are
demolished.  What is a tornado?  How are tornadoes measured and
formed?  Does Arkansas have to worry about tornado threats?  A
tornado is a circulation of winds that is faster in destruction than
any other storm.  Each tornado is measured by strength on a scale
known as the Fujita Scale.  Arkansas, including Conway, is in Tornado
Alley, the path across the United States that tornadoes are most
commonly formed.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&#147;Tornadoes
are violent rotating columns of air that are in contact with the
ground and originate in thunderstorms.&#148; This is the general and
widely used description of a twister.  Tornadoes are often coined as
twisters because of the rotation of wind that creates a funnel
(Weather).  A tornado is also defined as a wind tunnel that exists
when moist, warm air gets trapped beneath a stable layer of cold, dry
air by an intervening layer of warm, dry air.  Thunderstorms are the
first step in the making of a tornado.  The thunderstorms can produce
several tornadoes with other criteria.  There are three key factors
required for a thunderstorm to form.  One condition is moisture in
the lower to mid level of the atmosphere.  Next, unstable air, or air
that continues to rise once it begins traveling upward from near the
ground, helps elevate possible tornadoes.  The third is a lifting
force causes the air to rise.  The most common lifting force is
warming of the air near ground level.   Warm air is light and always
rises.  A cold front of cool air forces warm air upward and
thunderstorms develop (Weather).  </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	Therefore when all three of
these conditions are produced the air will rise high into the sky
creating an updraft.  As the air rises, it cools and the moisture in
it begins condensing to form a cloud.  When the lifting force is
strong enough, and the air contains enough moisture, the cloud can
tower more than 50,000 feet into the air, carrying it upward at more
than 100 miles per hour.  Raindrops and hail form inside the
thunderstorm due to the moisture dropping in temperature as it moves
upward into the atmosphere (Edwards).  The sky appears green to
onlookers because of the dust and debris that have collected in the
anvil, the upper portion of a storm. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	The strongest thunderstorms
normally form in humid air that is east or south of on-coming cold
air.  A southward, low-level jet of warm air 3,000 to 5,000 feet
above the ground energizes the thunderstorms that can eventually
create tornadoes.  Also dry wind from the southwest helps add power
to thunderstorms.  Finally, the extremely dangerous sorts of
thunderstorms are supercells, which are likely under the area where
jet stream winds are speeding-up.  This helps pull air upward,
increasing the thunderstorm&#146;s strength.  Tornadoes form in the
air that&#146;s ascending into a thunderstorm. Tornadoes take the
shape of a funnel. Many have a &#147;&#133;mist around them while
others have many subvortices working around them (Weather).&#148; 
However, the strongest tornadoes are often near the edge of the
updraft, not far from where the air is actually descending from the
thunderstorms.  Falling rain or hail pulls down air to form what is
known as a downdraft.  This is why a burst of heavy rain often hits
immediately before a tornado.  Since the tornado is in rising air,
wind is flowing in from the surrounding air, increasing the tornado&#146;s
energy.  A tornado can generate up to one billion watts of kinetic
energy (Weather).  This means that damaging winds can hit hundreds of
yards from the actual tornado vortex. These are known as subvortices
(Edwards). </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	Weather forecasters,
emergency management officials, and the public need to be aware of
how tornado climatology affects the world.  It is crucial for people
to comprehend the threat of tornadoes in the United States.  A
process has been developed to classify the location of tornado
touchdowns.  This conversion is complicated, but it is the best form
climatologists currently have.  The chance of a tornado  hitting any
certain square mile of land is about once every thousand years on
average, however this varies around the country.  This cannot be an
exact number because climatologists do not have an extended or
accurate enough record on tornadoes to make certain narrow
calculations.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Touchdown
patterns are usually sporadic in nature, so there is no such thing as
a &#147;skipping tornado.&#148;  A tornado must be in contract with
the ground to be considered an actual twister. Therefore when the
vortex is not on the ground, it is no longer a tornado.  Even if the
same vortex makes contact with the ground later, it is considered a
separate, individual tornado.  A tornado can destroy one house and
leave the next virtually unharmed (Edwards).  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Every
tornado formed has its own unique defining characteristics.  Whether
it is the speed of the winds or the shape of the funnel, they are all
classified in some distinctive way (&#147;Stormfax&#148;). The Fujita
Scale measures each tornado.  The Fujita Scale is based on damage,
not the appearance of a funnel.  An &#147;F&#148; followed by the
appropriate number, from 0 to 6, represents each level of the Fujita
Scale (&#147;Tornado Project&#148;).  </FONT>

<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	An
F0 is characterized as a gale tornado, causing some damage to
chimneys and tree limbs.  It also has the ability to push over
shallow-rooted trees and damage billboards.  An F1 tornado is
distinguished as a moderate tornado.  The lower limit of the tornado
is the beginning of hurricane wind speed.  This type of tornado can
peel surfaces of roofs, and even push mobile homes off foundations. 
These tornadoes like the F0, are very common.   The F2 tornadoes can
cause considerable damage.  Roofs can be torn off frame houses,
mobile homes can be demolished, and boxcars can be pushed over
(&#147;Tornado Project&#148;).  This is one of the most common
tornadoes in Tornado Alley.  An F3 is characterized as a remarkably
severe tornado.  These tornadoes can cause roofs to be torn off
well-constructed houses, trains to be overturned, and forest trees to
be uprooted.  These are some of the most devastating tornadoes that
hit heavily populated and industrialized areas.  Structures with weak
foundations can be blown off to great distances, and cars can be
thrown even farther.  These tornadoes are less common than the other
previously mentioned types, but are still seen throughout the United
States, including Arkansas (&#147;Stormfax&#148;).  In the F4
tornado, strong-framed houses are lifted off foundations and carried
considerable distances. This tornado was seen at the end of the
popular movie &#147;Twister.&#148;  The last level of the Fujita
Scale is a F5 tornado with an inconceivable aftermath.   The small
area of damage they might produce can probably not exist.   If this
level is ever achieved, evidence for it might only be found in some
manner of ground swirl pattern, for it may never by identifiable
through engineering studies (&#147;Tornado Project&#148;).  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	There
are also six different styles of tornadoes.  A dust devil can be
formed in light wind, and is formed from wind caused by different
temperatures of farm fields.  A style known as a gustnado occurs
along outflow boundaries.  They are narrower and shallower than land
spouts, Which are a horizontal sheer between boundaries causing a
vortex sheet.  With the correct sheer and instability, a land spout
can be created.  The third style is a hurricane-spawned tornado.  It
consists of rain bands in hurricanes that contain convection cells,
similar to supercells. A supercell develops in the boundaries between
a cold downdraft and a warm inflow, creating a kind of rolling funnel
of wind.  Lastly, a waterspout is, essentially, a tornado over water
that stretches to the cloud base (&#147;Stormfax&#148;).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	The
damage caused by tornadoes ranges from small limbs being blown off of
trees, to slight roof damage, to the complete destruction of homes. 
Depending on the intensity of the twister, a group may experience
only the frustrations of having to clean up debris from their yard,
or the horror of having to rebuild their lives.  Even worse is the
loss of life that sometimes accompanies these monster storms. 
Tornadoes rip through farmland destroying farmhouses, fence rows, and
ruining crops.  It gets even worse when they hit cities.  The damage
estimates rise to the millions, and the death tolls often increase as
well (&#147;Stormfax&#148;).  The vertical winds of tornadoes can be
powerful enough to pick up heavy objects such as the large, flat
sides of walls or roofs.  If the object is lightweight it can be
carried thousands of yards.  Though heavy objects usually are carried
a short distance, paper objects can be carried thousands of miles
(Edwards). </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	Tornadoes
also cause environmental damage.  By assessing a repot on May 12,
1999 from the sate of Oklahoma, it can be determined that if
tornadoes hit places that contain hazardous chemicals these materials
can be distributed into the environment.  They not only contaminate
the immediate surroundings, but also have the ability to carry toxins
great distances through the air.  They can also carry diseases found
in soil to other places.  This causes a wide state of concern.  Not
only chemical toxins, but also a more general topic is concerns
ecologists.  The natural world is destroyed by these natural
disasters.  Ecologists are interested in the &#147;fluid, on going&#148;
system that nature truly is.  &#147;The change in climate, nutrient
cycles, and the influx and departure of species&#148; is something
tornadoes influence greatly over time.  The effects of tornadoes
cause ecologists to ponder exactly how nature and forests have
changed throughout the centuries.  Over a 300-year period 20-40% of
nature was destroyed by tornadoes.  This observation arouses the
curiosity of many ecologists </FONT>

<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	Tornadoes
cause immense damage, not only physically, but mentally upon the
survivors.  The stress of losing property or a loved one can
sometimes be more than a person can handle.  On occasion the mental
stress can be greater than the physical damage.  This could lead to
severe depression and health problems in the future.  In addition to
the clean-up crews, there are also support groups on hand after a
tornado to help deal with the mental effects of the disaster.  </FONT>

<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	Much
of the data gathered shows low risk zones in the United States. 
Arkansas lies in the low risk, while Oklahoma and Kansas are
high-risk zones. Although this is stated, Arkansas still remains in
the path of Tornado Alley  (See Figure 1).   Tornado Alley is a
common term used to describe the high tornado occurrence in part of
the United States.  This alley covers central Texas to Nebraska and
Iowa then east to Arkansas.  Warm, humid air, thunderstorms, and
relatively organized storms feed tornadoes.  The Gulf of Mexico
supplies a large amount of warm wind and moisture that travels along
the Rockies.  These mountains in the western United States submit a
layer of dry, cold air about 3000 feet above the ground heading south
from Canada.  The Rockies act as a wall keeping the air eastward.  
The cold air can sometimes travel to the ground and collide with the
Gulf&#146;s humid air causing severe storms.  In the ideal setting,
updrafts can develop forming supercells becoming tornadic at times
(Cappella).  The Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains force
these fronts to remain in this channel-like area causing the sates
between them to be in constant caution of possible tornadoes
(Bergman, 62).   Tornadoes most commonly take place in the spring and
summer season and usually occur in the late afternoon or early
evening.  It must also be recognized that tornadoes can occur during
any time of the year at any hour of the day (&#147;Storm Damage&#148;).
(See Figure 2)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Arkansas
lies in Tornado Alley; as a result many tornadoes occur each year. 
An example of a rather devastating tornado happened on April 21,
1996.  According to Dave Hughes of the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, at
about 11:00PM a F2 magnitude tornado raced through Van Buren and Fort
Smith.  It destroyed much of downtown Fort Smith, demolishing many
homes on the north side before crossing over the river to Van Buren. 
 When the devastating storm ended, four lives had been taken.  The
storm caused an estimated three hundred million dollars of damage in
a stretch of six combined counties.  According to the Red Cross
Statistics, 435 homes and 60 apartments were destroyed in Van Buren. 
In the path of this phenomenon 660 homes were damaged.  In the Fort
Smith area the tornado took out 157 homes and damaged 1,350 homes
(Hughes).  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	Over
the years, Conway has experienced many tornadoes.  One such occasion
in 1965 a tornado occurred in Conway  (See Figure 3).  The tornado
touched down near the southern city limits on Highway 65 and
destroyed almost everything in its path northward toward the Arkansas
Children&#146;s Colony.  None of the children were killed, and only
about fifteen to twenty suffered injuries.  However, many others were
not so fortunate, six people were killed, and over one hundred people
injured by this specific twister.  Seventy-five homes were destroyed,
and the storm left destruction estimated from 5 million to 10 million
dollars (Schneider 1).  This storm was an F3 magnitude tornado with
winds as high as 200 mph (&#147;Tornado Project&#148;).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Mrs.
Betty Osborn recalled the storm vividly, &#147; We could see
insulation and other debris swirling in the air and falling back to
the ground.  It took a few minutes for us to realize how much
destruction must be in the path of the tornado.&#148;  Mrs. Osborn
continued to tell about people running into a church building for
shelter, but after the tornado had passed over, the only thing left
of the building was a concrete slab floor.  Mrs. Osborn discussed
about a friend, Jim Schneider, who miraculously survived the tornado
with only minor injuries from underneath his bed (Osborn).  The
particular tornado was an F5, which has the strength to pick houses
up and carry then a long-range distance, and suddenly drop the house
(&#147;Tornado Project&#148;).  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	Mr.
Schneider stated in the Log Cabin Democrat, &#147;I am alive
generally because I dived beneath my bed seconds before the room came
crashing down on it, and specifically because my Creator, for a
reason I&#146;ll never question, decided it wasn&#146;t my time yet.&#148;
Schneider went on to say that even after hours later he was still
numb, and those who have stared into the horrible eye of that
devastating, unbridled mass of energy knows what he means (Schnieder
1).  The mental distress of a tornado is inevitable.  Individual who
experience a tornado of this momentum are cognitively haunted by its
destruction.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">It
is amazing how a twister chooses what it will destroy.  How can a man
be left virtually unharmed under a bed while the house literally
falls down around him?  When a multiple-vortex tornado, or small
single vortex tornado occur this jump seems to happen.  A
multiple-vortex tornado may only have enough power to do minor damage
to a particular area.  Yet, a smaller tornado may hit the area with
speed of 200mph causing total destruction (Edwards).  (See Figure 4)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">More
recently, on January 21,1999, another set of tornadoes hit Faulkner
County.  Fortunately for the residents, there were no lives taken
(Magsam 1).  One of the homes destroyed was the Janes&#146; home. 
Mullins, a cousin speaking on behalf of the Janes&#146; family, said
the family saw the tornado bearing down on them. Since there was no
time to make it to a nearby storm shelter, they took cover in the
interior rooms of the home. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
&#147;He (Loyse Janes, Sr.) went into the bathroom with his grandson,
and when the tornado got through they were in a thicket and Loyse
still had a hold of the boy,&#148; said Mullins (Magsam 1).  This
particular tornado damaged homes, farms, businesses, and left an
impression on many lives.  Conway has seen many tornadoes pass
through because that it is clearly in the path of Tornado Alley. 
(See Figure 5)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">	Tornadoes
are destructive, circulating forces of wind that range from slight
misfortunes, an F1 tornado, to entire obliteration of an environment
and the lives of the residents in this area, an F5 tornado.   These
random acts of nature are produced from the action of two opposing
fronts battling each other.  The United States has an abundance of
tornadoes; however it has a specific area that seems to be
overflowing with twisters, Tornado Alley.  Unfortunately, Arkansas
lies in the alley that has been geographically chosen to be a victim
of frequent tornadoes.  The types, causes, and effects of tornadoes
are still being explored and discovered.  </FONT>
