churches established in a geographers aspect? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the beginning, Conway, Arkansas may have not
seemed like a town that would have 82 churches to come in its future
(conwayarkcc.org 1998, 26 November).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>After all it did have six saloons, a racetrack and a dance hall
(Gatewood, 1961).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Conway of today
is a very different from the Conway of the 1800’s. Two of those 82 churches are
St. Joseph Catholic and Pickles Gap Baptist, two very different churches with
two different histories, but both with one very similar mission: saving souls
(Gatewood, 1961).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Many factors have contributed to the immigration of
Catholics into Arkansas and subsequently to the settlement in Conway.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Important among these were the character and
background of the immigrants along with the skills and resources, which they
brought with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Personal traits were
not the only factors of this immigration, many geographic factors greatly
contributed to, if not caused, the influx of German Catholics (Lincoln, 1890).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Prior to 1832, there were some 2000
scattered Catholics in the Arkansas Territory but not a single priest.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In that year, Bishop Rosati of St. Louis
ordained several priests for his diocese and one was sent to the Arkansas
Territory. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>From 1817 to 1844, traveling
priests going between Missouri and the Indian Territories did Catholic missions
in Faulkner County (Brettels, 1966).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On
November 28, 1843, the Diocese of Little Rock was created.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Catholic population had increased enough
to justify establishing this new Diocese.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Reverend Andrew Byrne, an Irish priest from New York, was consecrated
Bishop of Little Rock on March 10, 1844.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>These missionaries had a profound impact on Faulkner County as well as
the other regions in which they occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>The missionaries served as a way to diffuse the Catholic religion as
well as the culture ascribed to it, as one would assume.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This type of diffusion, called contiguous
diffusion, is the process of an item or feature spreading though time, from one
place directly to a neighboring area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>These missionaries made it easier and more attractive for German
Catholics to migrate to Faulkner County (Brettel, 1966).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>By the end of the Civil War, Arkansas was in disarray
after being occupied for two years by Union troops.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Some of the problems that faced early Arkansas after the Civil
War included a decrease in the labor force, lawlessness, and personal
debts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The condition of Arkansas at
this time made finding a successor for the recently deceased Bishop Byrne
difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On February 5, 1867, the
problem was solved when Reverend Edward Fitzgerald, an immigrant from Limerick,
Ireland was consecrated Bishop of Little Rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The native Catholics were impoverished and disheartened from the
aftermath of the war, making the new Bishop’s role extremely demanding.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The period of Reconstruction was a hard time
for the Diocese of Little Rock, which at the time comprised the State of
Louisiana and the Indian Territory toward the West (Chester, 1927.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In order to truly understand what caused German
immigrants to come to America and Arkansas, one must understand the concepts of
push and pull factors of migration (Brettel, 1966).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>To understand a push factor it gives a clearness how people or
objects are drawn away and a pull factor which is opposite of drawing away, but
attracting to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Several push and pull
factors played a huge role in the surge of German Catholic immigration that
occurred in the mid to late 1800’s. During this period in history Otto von
Bismarck was the Chancellor of Prussia (What would later become modern day
Germany?), and German Catholics were a minority in Prussia.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Bismarck was not overly fond of the
population of German Catholics due to his fears that they were more loyal to
the Roman Catholic Church, than to Prussia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Bismarck assumed that the German Catholic Church was merely an
instrument in the hands of two foreign powers, the Vatican and France.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These fears were strengthened when the
population of German Catholics formed a new political party to ensure they
would not suffer injustice, the Catholic Center Party.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The formation of this party placed the
German Catholics directly against Bismarck and Prussia, and in line with
Prussia’s recent enemy France, or so Bismarck thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These conditions and feelings of mistrust
and treachery made life unbearable and often dangerous for German Catholics in
Prussia, made all the more miserable by the poor economic conditions brought on
by Bismarck’s economic plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These
conditions were the push factors for many German Catholics that made America
seem a much better place than Prussia at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>However, immigration did not occur simply because of the horrid
conditions in Prussia, the atmosphere in America made it a likely new home for
many immigrants, including the German Catholics.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>During the 1800’s America was actively seeking immigrants to
strengthen itself, and Arkansas was one of many states doing just that (Idom,
1998).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Bishop Fitzgerald, wanting to
strengthen German settlers in the state, secured from the Fort Smith-Little
Rock Railroad Company grants of land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>One of these grants was located in Conway, and the lad was offered to
the Catholic settlers coming into Arkansas, this is how St. Joseph’s Parish
began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The history of St. Joseph’s Parish
dates back to the arrival of the first Catholic family, which took place
shortly after Faulkner County was organized in 1873.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The county seat was originally called Conway Station, but two
years later it was changed to Conway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The first family to settle in what is now St. Joseph’s Parish was that
of Jacob Schichtl, who settled one mile east of Conway.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Schichtl settlement is now the site of
the Fryaldenhoven Nursery (Gateway, 1961). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In 1876, other Catholic families
taking advantage of Bishop Fitzgerald’s land grants joined the Schichtl
family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of these new immigrants
came to Faulkner County after reading an advertisement in a pamphlet called the
“Lichtern Stern”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the early years,
there were not enough priests to attend to all the new immigrants; therefore,
the spiritual wants of the few Catholics in Conway were attended by a secular
priest, Father Brehm, who traveled from Little Rock to Fort Smith, and
occasionally stopped in Conway should the mood strike.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1877, the first Holy Mass was given in
Conway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was offered on a makeshift
altar in the humble cabin of Joseph Schichtl where the seven Catholic families
were in attendance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At this time, the
small group of settlers was suffering many hardships.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Their first few years had witnessed a number of dry seasons.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result, many of the immigrants got sick
and died, while others left the county.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Those who did stay paid high prices for living necessities, making life
that much more difficult(Pope,1998).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In 1878, the Fathers of the Holy
Ghost took charge of the struggling parish (Herndon, 1927).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Holy Ghost Fathers came to Arkansas from
Zamesville, Ohio, where they had resided since coming to America from Germany.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While in Ohio, Father Joseph Strub persuaded
a group of their parishioners to migrate to Faulkner county and Arkansas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By assisting the people and encouraging
others from Germany to settle here Reverend Strub would soon transform the
little mission into a promising religious community. This time the United
States Government offered large grants of land on each side of the
railroad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Missouri Pacific Railroad
Company made a grant to the Holy Ghost Fathers establishing the property, which
was to become St. Joseph Church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Due to
this, there was a steady flow of settlers, because around 1880 many Polish and
German Catholics migrated to the United States, and subsequently to
Arkansas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This cheap land, which was
often sold for $2.00 to $6.00 an acre depending on the location, and the
interest, was as low as 4% (Thomas, 1947).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>As if the price of the land was not enticing enough Catholics received a
discount ranging from 10 to 15% off the price of the land.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>Again advertisements in the “Lichtern
Stern”, now called “St. Joseph’s Guiding Star”, many immigrants established themselves
in Conway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This cheap land,
advertisements, and a genuine need for skilled labor all pulled dissatisfied
German Catholics away from Prussia to the less confining United States of
America (Idom, 1998).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The Holy Ghost Fathers sent Father
Wilms, the first resident priest, to Conway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Father Wilms soon began the task of consolidating the 85 local Catholic
families into a parish family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
residents soon erected a church in 1878, under the guidance of Father
Wilms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first church was a modest frame
construction, but boasted an eighty-foot steeple.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In the late 1870’s, an additional 300 immigrants came into
Faulkner County to swell the parish role that had been depleted by a typhoid
epidemic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The church that had been
completed in 1879 was destroyed by a severe windstorm in 1883.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The parish priest at the time, Father
Steurer, left for Europe seeking aid in construction of a new church, after
seven years without a church Father Steurer returned from Germany with aid soon
to follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1890, a new church was
erected with the assistance obtained from the Leopold Verein in Austria and the
Bonafatius Verein in Germany.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet even
with this assistance, the parish would still be in debt for many
years.(Bettels,1966)<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In 1908 Father Zell came into
power, and quickly set out to clear the church of its heavy debt, which he was
successful at.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In March 1924, Father Joseph
Pobleschek succeeded Father Zell as Pastor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Father Pobleschek along with the growing parish family made plans for a
$60,000 new church in May 1924.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
cornerstone laying took place on March 22, 1925 by Bishop Morris of Little
Rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Visitors numbering around 3,000
were present for the occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
church was dedicated a year later, December 13, 1925.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>A few months after the dedication, disaster struck the church
again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A cotton compress near St.
Joseph Hall caught on fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The burning
embers were carried by a high wind, destroying the Hall.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Father Pobleschek immediately set upon the
task of rebuilding it, having only recently completed the new church (Idom,
1998).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Joe’s history is when the Germans decided to convert to Catholicism.<span

protect themselves, Catholic leaders founded the Catholic Center Party.<span
