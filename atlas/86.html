<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>	The term &quot;folk music&quot; was invented by
nineteenth-century scholars to describe the music of peasantry,
age-old and anonymous (9).  Folk music has been around for a long
time.   However, it was not until the early 1900s that scholars began
to consider folk music as a legitimate part of a culture. The
definition of folk music has been argued about for many years.  A
general definition of folk music is that it is music of the &quot;folk&quot;,
meaning the uneducated people.  These are usually the rural or
peasant people of a country, but sometimes are considered to be of a
particular ethnic group or nationality (7).  Some people believe that
it exists in all classes of society, however (8).  A folk culture is
a culture that preserves traditions, and are held together by a
certain language, religion, or background.  They are usually not
prone to change and are relatively isolated.  These communities work
together to preserve their traditional cultural values.  Diffusion
from one culture to another is sometimes difficult because of the
geographic barriers.  Some of these barriers can include mountains,
large bodies of water, and climate.  Mountains are probably one of
the main barriers, because it can be very hard to get in touch with
the outsider world if you are trapped in a small town high in the
mountains.  It could take days of horseback riding through dangerous
areas to reach another town.  It can be very hard to get any kind of
signal for a phone or television in some places.  Even satellites are
almost impossible to use.  This is a major barrier to acculturation. 
Acculturation is when one cultural group adopts many of the
characteristics of another more dominant culture.  Some climates,
such as deserts or rain forests, can also be very hard to navigate
through and find anyone else.   There are also many cultural barriers
to diffusion.  These include religion, ethnicity, and social classes.
 Religion is probably the most prominent of these.  Some religions
don&#146;t take well to the beliefs of others.  For example, the
slaves preserved their own folk music by singing in the fields and
passing it down to each generation, and their white owners did not
associate with this. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>	One important part of the definition of folk music is
that it includes the oral transmission, that is the handing down of
songs and thoughts by word of mouth to each generation.  The
International Folk Music Council adopted this definition at its
Annual Conference in London in 1952. Folk music is &quot;music that
has been submitted to the process of oral transmission. It is the
product of oral transmission. It is the product of evolution and is
dependent on the circumstances of continuity, variation and
selection.&quot;  Folk music may change and evolve as it passes from
person to person, but the music must be very old, and be a particular
style of music, and that the author is usually not known. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Folk music also has a simple melody. Brand (2)
described the American folk song as &quot;distinguishable by a
special sound, a kind of 'simple' noise&quot; (p. 10). Bohlman (1)
talked about folk music's ability to &quot;express the most profound
of human values&quot; (p. xii).  Historically, both folk and popular
music are learned through hearing and performing, but that performers
of &quot;serious&quot; music have formal training in music theory,
composition, and more (4).  There are two kinds of popular music, the
folk and mass forms. The folk form is performed live, and the mass
form is recorded (Cutler, 1985). </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Forcucci is the author of a schoolbook on the history
of folk music in America.  Because the oral transmission definition
of folk music is obsolete and much of the music is transmitted by the
mass media today, Forcucci put folk music into two basic categories:
traditional folk songs and modern urban folk songs. He gave eight
generalizations by which one may define folk music.  The
generalizations are as follows:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.13in; margin-right: 0.25in; margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>1. Folk songs represent the musical expressions of the
common people.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.13in; margin-right: 0.25in; margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>2. These songs are not composed in that they are not the
works of skilled, tutored musicians. It is more accurate to say that
they have been created rather than composed.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.13in; margin-right: 0.25in; margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>3. These songs are ordinarily the product of an unknown
person or group of persons. The credits often read: Anonymous;
American Folk Song; Traditional; or Southern Mountain Song. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.13in; margin-right: 0.25in; margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>4. The words or lyrics of folk songs are usually
informal in nature to reflect the speech patterns and expressions of
a particular people or region.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>5. These songs are highly singable, primarily because
they were first presented with the singing voice rather than have
been written down in musical notation beforehand.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.13in; margin-right: 0.25in; margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>6. Folk songs are simply structured, both musically and
verbally. It is their innocence that gives them their charm.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.13in; margin-right: 0.25in; margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>7. These songs can be effectively performed without
instrumental accompaniment. When they are accompanied, a less formal
instrument (such as a guitar, banjo, accordion or dulcimer) is
considered appropriate.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.13in; margin-right: 0.25in; margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>8. Folk songs are indigenous to a particular region or
people because they reflect the musical/verbal preferences of that
people or region in their materials. (3)</FONT></P>

of Folk Music and its relation to other cultures</B></I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>	There are many different roots of folk music.  For
example, the first English settlers in the early 1600s that came to
America brought with them hymns, fiddles, and ancient ballads from
the English and Irish traditions.  The old ballads from Britain and
Ireland later evolved into gospel songs, work songs and Negro
spirituals that flourished on the plantations of the American South. 
Black folk music originated on the West Coast of Africa when the
slave trade began.  African-based music included work songs sung in a
call and response pattern common to African chants. When the black
slaves came to the New World, they proceeded to convert to
Christianity and began to sing the protestant hymns of the colonies.
(10)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Though the African American culture by some was thought
to be the first culture to create folk music, this thought is not
actually true. The African American culture instead served as an
important foundation for it. The period of slavery was a time when
the African-American race was suffering and enduring great
oppression. The outlet from suffering, created by the tormented
people, was one that led to spiritual dances, ballads and songs. Some
say that the Negro path to freedom was one driven by relentless hope,
originated in the forceful verses sung by the distraught people.
Although there was no slavery in the heart of the Ozark Mountains,
some of the powerful folk writings written by the African American
culture were created in the heart of these mountains.  (10)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Folk music is actually an amalgamation of many
different cultures.  This means that it is kind of a melting pot of
many cultures.  The cultures don&#146;t really lose their identity,
but instead all come together in one place from many different
places.  </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT SIZE=3><B><I>	</I></B>The instruments used are one of the most
important parts of a music. Folk music is very different from any
other kind. The human voice is the most important instrument used in
folk music, if it can really be considered an instrument. This is how
the music was passed down to generations and one of the only ways
that the songs have survived until today. The fiddle is the next most
important instrument.  It is sometimes known as a violin, but
musicians know that there are distinct differences between the two. 
The fiddle has a lower bridge so that a number of strings can be
played at the same time.  Fiddlers use a different kind of string
than violinists do also.  One reason why folk musicians favor the
fiddle over the violin is because of its small size, which makes it
easy to transport around the country (McNeil 103). The guitar is
another important instrument.  Most folk bands consist of the lead
singer, one or more fiddlers, and a guitar and banjo.  The mountain
dulcimer is an instrument sometimes used in folk music, but not
nearly as much.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><B><I>	</I></B>Jimmy Driftwood is one of the most
influential people in the history of folk music. He was born in
Timbo, Arkansas, a town about 12 miles from Mountain View.  He was
the founder of the Rackensack Folklore Society, located in Mountain
View.  Along with his friends, he built the Jimmy Driftwood Barn and
Folklore Hall of Fame, which is also in Mountain View.  Jimmy was a
high school teacher and wrote songs to help his class learn.  The
song &#147;The Battle of New Orleans&#148; was written in order to
help Jimmy explain to his class that the Battle of New Orleans was
fought during the War of 1812, and not the Revolutionary War as they
had thought.  He composed over 6,000 songs, including &#147;The
Tennessee Stud&#148;, &#147;Down in the Arkansas&#148;, and &#147;He
had a Long Chain On.&#148;  He won two Grammy Awards for his music
and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Folklore from Peabody
University in Nashville, Tennessee.  He was known as the &#147;Bard
of the Ozarks&#148; to the thousands of fans that followed him.  He
wanted to create a festival that everyone would enjoy, so he started
the Arkansas Folk Festival.  It is one of the most important folk
festivals in the United States today.  Jimmy Driftwood is probably
the most important figure in the history of folk music.  </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>		As
you have seen, folk music means different things to different
cultures.  It can all be traced back to the same common roots
however.  Folk music was assimilated into the culture of Arkansas
through many different ways, and will probably even change in the
generations to come.  There have been many barriers to the diffusion
of folk music, but a love for folk music has overcome many of these,
though it has taken a long time.  Even though folk music is ever
changing, it has been and will always be an important part of
Arkansas's past.  <B>(Note: Inorder to listen to some samples of
different forms of Folk music, see the music websites page.)</B>	</FONT></P>
