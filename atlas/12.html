<P>&#9;Ever since the late 1980’s the Hispanic population in Northwest Arkansas has grown tremendously.  Various factors have contributed to this growth.  Are these immigrants going to stay, or are they just temporary visitors to our state?  What factors have drawn them to Northwest Arkansas?  Exactly how many have immigrated and at what rate?  Based on our research, we believe we have found the answers to these questions.</P>
<P>&#9;To understand some of the factors involved in migration it is imperative to know some basic principles of geography.  Geographers have divided the causes for migration into push factors and pull factors.  This is relatively easy to grasp.  &quot;Push factors drive people away from wherever they are (Intro to Geography p179).&quot;  Push factors could include starvation, religious persecution, or standards of living.  &quot;Pull factors attract people to new destinations (Intro to Geography p179).&quot;  Pull factors can include religious freedom or economic opportunities (Intro to Geography p179).  Physical geography can also serve as a push or pull factor.  For instance, one could say that the warm climate of the U.S. Sunbelt has attracted people from the colder northern regions.  In contrast, we could also say that environmental disruption in the African Sahel has been found unbearable by the emigrants from that region (Intro to Geography p179).  </P>
<P>&#9;The big question on most people’s minds is, why Northwest Arkansas?  What could possibly draw Hispanics or anyone there?  For the most part, many of the Hispanics came from less-developed and generally poor communities (Democrat Gazette 1997), which is a strong push factor.  They came to America seeking better lives and job opportunities, mainly because employment was scarce in Mexico (another push factor).  For others it was a second migration from states like California or Texas.  Either way, they each sought job opportunities and a new way of life (Democrat Gazette 1997).  Northwest Arkansas seemed to be the ideal place for many of these immigrants.  The poultry industry is a large part of Arkansas’ economy, and has many jobs available to the public.  Immigrants came to work for Tyson, Petit Jean Meats, Wayne Farms, and many also worked for independent poultry plants throughout the region (Channel 7 report), a pretty big pull factor if your previous region had low employment rates.  Tyson states it did no active recruiting in Mexico as some residents in Northwest Arkansas claimed.  They did, however, start a campaign in the early 1990’s offering incentives to employees who brought new workers to the plant.  The corporation printed these incentives on paper flyers in both English and Spanish.  Tyson administrators stated that they needed Hispanics because they could not get enough local help.  They claimed that the Hispanics worked hard, showed up on time, and were willing to do the work that few of the local Anglos would do (Democrat Gazette 1997).  After initially coming to work in the poultry industry many moved on to different jobs and occupations.  Some went on to start their own business, Mexican restaurants became very popular.  Many retail stores opened as well.  Overall, the main social factors for immigration involve language, religion, acceptance of ethnic diversity, and whether or not relatives are living in the area (Cossman, Powers Presentation 1999).</P>
<P>&#9;Once the immigrants were settled in they became very happy with the low crime rate and general tranquility of Northwest Arkansas.  This gave them a good reason to invite friends and family to come over from Mexico (Channel 7 report).  This is an example of a migration chain.  An example of a migration chain is when successful immigrants write home, and they pave the way for new arrivals by providing them with employment and financial assistance (Intro to Geography p180).  Combined with the incentive for decent paid work, even more Hispanics were drawn into the area.</P>
<P>&#9;Naturally, the towns receiving these immigrants were faced with many new problems they weren’t prepared for (Democrat Gazette 1999).  Schools, hospitals, and law enforcement agencies were unfamiliar with the problems that they were confronted with.  Language barriers, lack of knowledge of laws and customs on the part of the immigrants, and shortage of adequate housing and schooling facilities were just some of the major problems (Democrat Gazette 1997).  Many towns developed a pro-active policy toward the new immigrants.  Rogers is a good example of this.  They set up a Spanish speaking day in their local courthouse for the people who could not speak English.  Judge Shrantz, of Rogers, states that Spanish-speaking defendants &quot;will plead guilty 99% of the time&quot; if they do not understand the case in its entirety (Democrat Gazette 1997).  The school system assigned Al Lopez, an immigrant from Puerto Rico, to set up programs and meetings to help both teachers and students understand one another.  Not all the people of Northwest Arkansas were as welcoming and receptive to the new members of their community.  Many were feeling threatened, and others were simply just prejudice against non-whites (The Economist 1998).  Several anti-immigration organizations have been created to stop the flow of immigrants into the state (Democrat Gazette 1998).</P>
<P>&#9;For the most part, these Hispanics are trying to establish a permanent homestead.  Based on the establishment of houses and businesses in the areas it is likely to assume that these people are settling permanently, or at least for a long period of time.  </P>
<P>&#9;Exactly how many Hispanics are coming into Arkansas?  Well, according to Figure 1 we can see that Arkansas has the highest percent increase in Hispanics of any state with 127.1%.  In 1997 there were an estimated 19,878 Hispanics in Arkansas.  In 1997 there were 45,134.  This is a dramatic increase for an area the size of Arkansas, a little over 127%.  Growth in particular Counties has swelled too.  Faulkner had 341 Hispanics in 1990, and an estimated 919 in 1997.  That is a 170% growth rate for Faulkner County (Cossman Presentation 1998).  Communities with poultry industries seem to be affected the most.  The kindergarten class in the small community of Danville is 40 percent Hispanic (Channel 7 report).  Numbers like these are hard to ignore.  Despite these outlandish growth rates Arkansas still only has 0.8% of its population as Hispanics.  And Faulkner County is only 0.01%.  Figure 2 shows the Hispanic population and percentage of population for 1990, Figure 3 shows the same for 1997 (Cossman Presentation 1998).  </P>
<P>&#9;However, not all immigrants are being counted.  There are a large amount of illegal immigrants crossing the border and coming into the state of Arkansas (Log Cabin 1999).  Government officials are trying new methods to encourage the Hispanic population to participate in Census 2000.  The Census Bureau rates Arkansas’ Hispanic population growth rate of 10.1 percent in this decade as the highest in the nation (Log Cabin 1999).  This estimate doesn’t include the number of illegal aliens coming in to our state.  The Census Bureau has enlisted the help of the Catholic Church to help encourage Hispanics to participate in the census (Log Cabin 1999).  Census figures are used in many federal programs as a means of distributing financial assistance where it is needed as well as apportioning Congress among the several states.  This makes it a vital statistic for the next decade (Log Cabin 1999).</P>
<P>&#9;The influx of Hispanic immigrants into the state has brought about many challenges.  Our society has many different views concerning the immigrants; some see them as a problem while others welcome them openly.  Despite attempts at slowing or stopping migration, it is very likely that the Hispanic population will continue to increase in the next decade.  Most regions are adapting to the challenges of having a large population of foreigners.  It is very likely that we will see a melding of cultures in the future as well as a large Hispanic influence on our economy.  Hopefully we can all learn to live together and put aside our differences to make our society a better place to live.  And maybe now you can explain to your grandmother why Hispanics are coming into Northwest Arkansas. </P>
