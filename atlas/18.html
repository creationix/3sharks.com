mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
true battles between colleges rage in athletic competition, and no single
entity represents a college more than the mascot, whether he’s rallying the
troops on the football field or proudly emblazoned on letterhead stationary
(Stiefel 1999).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mascots are chosen in
an effort to show pride in heritage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   
</span>In the Southern states, like Arkansas, symbols of the Old South and
antebellum South are extremely popular.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Examples of this would be the Confederate Soldier, Johnny Reb, who is a
common mascot around southern areas (The School Mascot Controversy, Chalk
Talk).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Animals common to the area are
also used, like the University of Central Arkansas Bear.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, for public relations reasons and to
avoid conflicts with minorities, colleges are moving to adopting an animal as a
mascot rather than mascots that represent, or misrepresent, people (Shea
1993).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, Native American symbols
like Redskins, Braves, Redmen, and Savages are a common theme for mascots
throughout the United States, but they are more prominent in the South.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Native American cultural practices, Indian
dress, weapons, artifacts, and music are used to boost enthusiasm for the team
and the entire school. The Atlanta Braves tomahawk chop makes<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>for an excited and more unified crowd of
fans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Traditions like mascots, logos,
flags, and songs provide a feeling of inclusiveness and pride (The Tomahawk
Chop).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
ten most common mascots in the United States are the Eagles, Tigers, Cougars,
Bulldogs, Warriors, Lions, Panthers, Indians, Wildcats, and Bears.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These mascots are chosen typically because
they are perceived as savage, powerful, and wild.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They are also a reflection of the area’s heritage and what is
regionally common.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Colleges compete for
the reputation of machismo and muscle in the criteria of a mascot.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mascots are also selected precisely because
of their coercive and predatory images.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Such attributes of violence, dominance, and power are considered and
preferred over compassion, cooperation, and individuality (Segrave 1997).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

attending the University of Central Arkansas realize that the bear is the
schools mascot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But many students and
professors are clueless when it comes to the question of how UCA acquired this
animal for a mascot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First, one must
acknowledge both UCA’s history and the history of the state of Arkansas itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In
the early nineteen hundreds, the University of Central Arkansas went by a
different name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was called Arkansas
Normal College or Arkansas State Teachers College.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>“The Bear, as a symbol, came officially to the normal in 1920”
(Worley 33).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>In November of that year,
Sam A. Huffman, an art student, created a new design for the senior class
rings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He incorporated the bear in the
seal and it became official when approved by the board of trustees.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The Bear was an appropriate symbol for an
Arkansas school because the nickname of the state was the Bear State.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Athletic teams were first called Bears in
print April 7, 1921 in a <u>Log Cabin</u> report of a baseball game” (Worley
33).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Writers welcomed and preferred the
change of name to Bears over previous names such as “Normalites,” “Pedagogues,”
“Teachers,” and “Pea-Pickers.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the new mascot, the Bear, seemed more convenient, it did have a few
drawbacks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A live bear as a mascot was
not very practical, and the stone bear attracted green shades of paint, the
rival school, Arkansas Tech’s color during times of competition.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For several years, however, a live bear
belonging to L.S. Dunaway was used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>“Big Boy” was paraded around at Estes Field and taken up to Russellville
for Tech games (Worley 34).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1947,
permission of the board was given for a solid, gray bear to stand guard
directly in front of the main entrance of the administration building.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The University of Cental Arkansas Alumni
Association further states, “Strength and justice are illustrated by the
institution’s mascot, the Bear” (http://www.uca.edu/alumni/member.htm).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

universities in the state of Arkansas, and each has it’s own very unique
mascot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Harding University, Arkansas
Tech, and Henderson State University are all in the Gulf South Conference with
the University of Central Arkansas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This means that the Bears oppose teams with mascots like the Bisons,
Wonders Boys, Golden Suns, and Reddies (Gulf 2000:1).<span style="mso-spacerun:

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>According to Scott Goode,
the sports information director at Harding University, students attending the
university chose the bison as their mascot in 1924.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>At that time, it was grammatically acceptable to spell the word
with the &quot;s&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was during
this year that Harding University moved from Morrilton to Searcy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The students most likely chose this mascot
because there were still quite a few buffalo in Arkansas at this time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The teams of Henderson State
University are known as &quot;Reddies&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>There are many theories about the origin of this name, but it most
likely came from the jersey color.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Early teams were referred to as &quot;Red Jackets&quot; and &quot;Red
Men&quot; before Nellie Hartsgeld officially named the football team the
&quot;Red Jackets.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By 1908,
reporters had shortened this name to &quot;Reds.&quot;<span

the director of media services at Arkansas Tech, the name &quot;Wonder
Boys&quot; originated in 1909.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tech’s
football team upset the Jonesboro Aggies, 14-0.<span style="mso-spacerun:

game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>John Tucker, the 17-year-old
quarterback, led his team to an awesome victory.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Henry Loesch, who was a sports editor of the Arkansas Gazzette at
the time, was the first person to call Tech the &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; because
of this game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This led to the girls’
teams being called the &quot;Wonderettes.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In 1975, the girls decided to vote on a new name.<span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>While the Southern states’
school symbolize animal-like figures, it seems that more schools and colleges
in the north have mascots that are not animal-like. Northern mascots seem to
resemble or represent fighting, warrior-like symbols. Despite these differences
there is something similar about northern and southern mascots. It is the fact
that while the mascots are different in meaning and figure, they are
non-humanistic in outlook. Some southern school mascots are: Kansas Jayhawks,
Arkansas Razorbacks, Texas Longhorns, Georgia Bulldogs, Florida Gators,
Kentucky Wildcats, and South Carolina Gamecocks. Another example of using
animals as mascots are the southern schools that use tigers to represent them.
Such schools are the Louisiana State Tigers, Missouri Tigers, and Auburn
Tigers. The northern schools seem to focus more on the fighting and war-like
figures for mascots. Some examples are: Illinois Fighting Illini, USC's
Trojans, Purdue Boilermakers, Michigan State Spartans, Ohio State Buckeyes, and
the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. These schools are examples of fighting mascots
and are non-animal-like. The Northern schools listed above show that the North
has different types of mascots than the southern schools. However, there are
exceptions to this rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are also
northern schools that have animal mascots, while some southern schools have
non-animal figures, but the majority stay true to norm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Schools around the nation
have come up with their mascots in many different ways.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some school mascots and symbols have a direct
relation with the region’s history or tradition, while others may have nothing
to do with the history and tradition of that region and are just to rally
spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An example of this is the way
Notre Dame came about to find their mascot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They were first called the “Catholics” in the eighteen hundreds, but in
the years of the four horsemen they were renamed the “Ramblers.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Years later, in 1927, Notre Dame officially
became know as the “Fighting Irish.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No
one is completely certain on how the school got this nickname, but there are
many different stories circulating that try to explain the change.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These stories range anywhere from a teammate
using that name as an inspirational pep talk to other teammate before a game,
to a rival calling Notre Dame the “Fighting Irish” as an insult.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another school that got its nickname
completely out of the blue is Michigan State.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Their mascot was chosen by a contest to find a new mascot for the
school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This person who came up with
“Spartans” did not win the contest because he was not well liked by the rest of
the community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a few years the
school’s president looked over the contest again and decided the name
“Spartans” was the most suitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The University of Illinois
was one school that got its nickname from history and tradition.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The school’s mascot is named an Illini.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It got this nickname from a local Indian
chief by the name of Illiniwek who was the leader of a loose confederation of
Algonquin tribes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His name means “they
are men,” and former Illinois coach Robert Zuppke believes this is where the
“Fighting Illini” got their name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
