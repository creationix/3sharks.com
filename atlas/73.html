<IMG SRC="sv99e99f.jpg" NAME="G1: wcycle" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=460 HEIGHT=468 BORDER=0>Water
moves in a continuous cycle. This cycle is called the hydrologic
cycle. All of the water in Arkansas flows around in this natural
circle of &#147;water recycling&#148;. To be specific, it goes
through something called discharge and recharge. Recharge is the
infiltration of precipitation or water from the streams or lakes into
the ground water (Bryant, Ludwig, Morris: 4). Discharge occurs
naturally when the ground water system is at capacity and cannot
accept additional water (Bryant, Ludwig, Morris: 4). Water movement
goes through the earth&#146;s atmosphere, all the way to below the
earth&#146;s surface. You need to know how this part of the cycle
works before you can understand how pollutants are breaking down this
natural phenomenon in the state of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Let&#146;s assume our starting point is the evaporation point.
Evaporation is when water is carried up into the atmosphere in a
gaseous, and collected into what we see as clouds (Bryant, Ludwig,
Morris: 4). All the water that is evaporated from Arkansas is taken
from our lakes, rivers, streams, soils, and transpiration from
plants. All this forms our clouds overhead. These clouds later return
our water to us in the form of precipitation. Arkansas&#146; most
common form of precipitation is rainfall. Part of this rain
infiltrates into the ground, while the rest run off into streams,
rivers, and lakes. After this where it again evaporates back into the
atmosphere. This sounds so simple, yet it is more complicated, and
that&#146;s where we run into the trouble of water pollution. Runoff
is where a major part of the problem lies. The amount of runoff that
a given storm will generate is dependent on the hydrological
characteristics of the watershed in which the rainfall occurs. Urban
development increases runoff by altering the attributes of a certain
natural watershed that tends to inhibit runoff. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<IMG SRC="sv99e99h.gif" NAME="G2: NA01441_" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=420 HEIGHT=516 BORDER=0>The
precipitation that flows into the ground passes through two zones,
the unsaturated, and the saturated. The unsaturated zone consists of
the land surface itself, and up to several feet beneath the surface.
This zone supports the soil, insects, and bacteria living in the
soil. The permeability of this zone is dependent on these living
organisms that reside there. This area filters water, keeps runoff to
a minimum, and also brings water down in to recharge zone through
plant&#146;s roots that live in the dirt. Permeable materials also
allow contaminates to enter the ground-water system. Therefore, the
potential for contamination is closely related to the recharge rate.
Leaves on trees shrubs, and grass intercept raindrops; therefore a
part of that rain adheres to plant surfaces. When the storage
capacity of the watershed is reached, dense vegetation impedes the
flow of runoff. In an urban environment there is generally less
vegetation to intercept rainfall. This of course causes runoff to
increase.  When we continually build and construct, we take away our
natural water filter. Farm&#146;s agriculture wastes seep into our
soil through this process and filter into our ground water. Run off
of oil and dirt from cars on the interstates flows off into ditches
and seeps into the ground water. Once again we cannot make new water,
so in a twisted way we drink all these pollutants. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
The saturated zone is what we refer to as our ground water. The
saturated zones we actually use as a population are referred to
aquifers. It can only be called aquifer if the water from the
recharged unsaturated zone can yield usable quantities of water to
wells or springs, the key word being usable. All of this groundwater
movement is only one phase of the Hydrologic Cycle.

<IMG SRC="sv99e99j.gif" NAME="G3: BD05219_" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=299 HEIGHT=204 BORDER=0>Ground
water occurs in two settings of the state. The southeast corner is
called the Gulf Coastal Plain. The North West Corner is referred to
as The Interior Highlands (Fenneman, 1938 AR. Ground water problems).
All ground water is closely related to the types of rocks that exist
in each geographic area. The Gulf Coastal Plain makes up
approximately 27,000 square miles of southeast Arkansas (AR. Water
Pro.Mang.Report 1999). Water in this area is particularly abundant.
This ground water is actually obtained from six different aquifers;
Quaternary deposits, Cockfield Formation, Sparta Sand, Wilcox Group,
Nacatoch Sand, and the Tokio Formation. These are just the main ones;
some rural areas may have other supply sources. The Quaternary
Deposit has a main use. It is where we typically get our irrigation
water. The remaining five are a thick sequence of semi-consolidated
sediments containing water bearing units that spread out parallel to
the fall line. This &#147;Fall Line&#148;, divides the Gulf Coastal
and the Interior Highlands. All of these formations are made of thick
layers of sand that is essential to freshwater aquifers. Though this
area has water available, large-scale withdrawals are consequently
causing water levels to decline at a rapid rate (AR. Dept. of
Pollution Control and Ecology; 1998).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
The Interior Highlands encompass about 31,000 square miles in the
northwest half of the state and are underlain by thick sequences of
consolidated rocks consisting of limestone, dolomites, sandstones and
shale (AR. Water Pro.Mang.Report 1999). The ground water occurs in
the fractures of these layers of sandstone and limestone joints.
These are the water source of many rural homes in the region. Water
is not as abundant as in the Gulf Coastal, nonetheless wells can
average about 150 feet in depth, and yield less than 10 gallons per
minute (National Water Quality Inventory:1998 http://www.epa.gov).
This is why ground water is relatively scarce in this area, and we
have to find other sources that are more readily available. Ground
water is always governed by natural constraints. The rockier, the
less water you can get to, and the flatter and softer, the better.
Now that we have general idea of how Arkansas water works, lets find
out how pollution is affecting it.</P>

Water pollution can be defined as the contamination of streams,
lakes, underground water, bays, or oceans by substances harmful to
living things (Dr. Ken Rubin Assistant Professor, Univ. Hawaii).
There are two general categories; &#147;direct&#148; and &#147;indirect&#148;
contaminant sources. These can also be described as &#147;point&#148;
and &#147;non-point&#148; sources. Direct sources come from waste
products of factories and waste treatment plants, where as indirect
come from agricultural products. These indirect sources seep into our
ground water, and eventually find there way back into the atmosphere
through the hydrologic cycle. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Contaminates have their own categories. Some include organic and
inorganic, radioactive, and acid/base contaminants. Some contaminants
from industrial wastes appear to have entered shallow aquifers (AR.
Dept. of Pollution Control and Ecology). Recent reports have shown
concentrations of arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury,
nitrate, selenium, and silver. All of which are exceeding safe
drinking water limits. In addition to these organic contaminants,
studies show ethlenedibromide, and phenols, for which no limits have
been established (AR. Dept. of Pollution Control and Ecology). 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
The potential for groundwater contamination by hazardous materials
disposed of on the land surface coincide generally with the recharge
rate to aquifers (Morris: 12). Sources of high potential problems are
waste impoundments, landfills (open, and filled), and hazardous waste
operations. Other more rural problems can be storage tanks, septic
tanks, waste injection wells, and pipelines leading to rivers and
streams. Mining activities and wastes spilled during transport are
other causes as well. There are more than 340 landfills, including
sanitary landfills, open dumps, legally closed dumps, and abandoned
ones (AR. Dept. of Pollution Control and Ecology). Though we have
this information, we still lack the knowledge of what has been
disposed in them. Further more, we have little to no documentation on
any underlying aquifers.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
Water pollution affects everyone and everything. Poisons are in our
drinking water, in plants that other animals eat, that in turn we
eat, and there lies the cycle of contamination. Water never goes away
it just goes in a cycle. It has been here since the beginning of
time. The quality of our water is not what it was during the dinosaur
age though.

is known as the Natural State, even though we have our share of
environmental problems. One of them being water pollution. Siltation
and turbidity are the most frequently identified pollutants impairing
Arkansas&#146; rivers and streams (EPA 1998 report to Congress). The
number one pollutant in Arkansas is agriculture waste, followed by
municipal wastewater treatment plants, mining, industrial discharges,
and construction waste. Most of these pollutants flow directly into
the rivers and streams, rather than the lakes of Arkansas. For the
most part however, Arkansas has above average water quality. The
Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality reported 69% of surveyed
rivers and streams and 100% of lakes have good water quality that
fully supports aquatic life uses. Arkansas uses six different

In 1972 we as a nation took a great step to clean up the water
problem. The Clean Water Act was passed, and every state had to take
part, including Arkansas(http://www.greentruck.com). This law, in
theory, was supposed to help pollution discharges into surface
waters. Any one who did discharge pollution had to have a permit by
federal law and over time reduce the amount they gave off. This law
also authorized federal grants to help states build water treatment
plants that remove pollutants. As a result of this law, our water
quality has dramatically improved.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
A survey of rivers and streams in 1990 found that three-quarters of
these waters were clean enough for fishing and swimming (Hart 2000).
The Safe Drinking Water Act passed in 1974 by The EPA set standards
for every state to filter water treatment plants. This law was
amended in 1986 and 1996 to keep up with further changes. Among other
changes, the SWDA required all water drawn from surface water
supplies be filtered to remove <I>Crytospordium </I>bacteria by the
year 2000. It is said that America has the safest drinking water in
the world, but many water utilities provide tap water that failed to
meet EPA standards. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
More close to home, the Arkansas Nonpoint Source Pollution Management
Program is working to help Arkansas water quality. This group closely
monitors water quality, research into helping problems, and the
impanation of correcting problems. Counties that have used funds from
(Section 319) to clean up water pollution, due to agricultural
products include; Van Buren, White, Cleburne, Conway, and Faulkner.
These districts used this grant to purchase, restore, and maintain a
portable land application system for liquid animal waste. The system
collects 30 to 40 different dairies waste products and dispose of
them in field to give nutrients to soil. These programs helped show
farmers how to take their harmful water, recycle it, and return it to
the pastures. The state of Arkansas Department of Pollution Control
and Ecology Water Division made drastic changes in the 1990&#146;s.

To help with the agricultural waste farmers can do little things to
help clean up. Dead poultry composting, nutrient management
programming, pasture management, proper grazing use, waste management
systems, and waste management ponds are all things that Arkansas
farmers can take part in. In other words, if we can recycle what is
waste at first, we can greatly decrease the numbers. We have to act
responsively with the use of household chemicals, and their disposal.
Driving to work every day has an affect on water pollution because of
run off, and the hydrologic cycle. Getting involved, as a community
is what it will take to fix the current water problems. An example of
this is Cadron Creek. Cadron Creek watershed is a five county rural
region of central Arkansas. It also has one of the highest
concentrations of poultry and dairy farming (section 319 II). Cadron
Creek is used for numerous recreation activities. Brewer Lake is
where Morrilton and Conway get their drinking water. This region as a
community has used money to educate farmers in animal waste
management. There are other ways to help keep water clean. In the
fields plowing at an upward slope from the streams and rivers will
help run off. Leaving trees and other vegetation that line the banks
of water sources help keep erosion from happening, and keeps
stability when fighting sediment buildup. At home in the city people
can help too by not dumping old engine oil that can contaminate near
by water sources. Garden pesticides and fertilizers can cause
eutrophication, so building our own compost heaps to use as fertilzer
would be more effecitent. Construction sites can lay down tarps, and
build sediment traps. They can also lie out grass seeds to encourage
plant growth. There are many different organizations that people can
join. Consult your government pages in the telephone book to learn
more about environmental quality groups.</P>

Conway receives its drinking water from Brewer Lake in Conway County.
In the 1980&#146;s, The Corps of Engineers awarded a contract for a
dam to be built on Brewer Lake. In 1982 it was finished, and a
reservoir area was cleared by 1983. Brewer Lake covers 1165 acres,

The water purification system starts The Gleason Water Treatment
Plant on Highway 64 West at Highway 319. There is a pipeline from the
lake that takes the water to a flash mixer where it is put in with
lime, alum, and sometimes carbon to remove the impurities from the
water. After this process flocculators rotate the water to keep the
silt from settling. The water then goes to two clarifiers where the
silt is allowed to settle and siphons can later pick up the silt from
the bottom.</P>

screens. This process removes up to 50% of the TSS and BOD</B> (Water

This process removes all other remaining organisms. An Aeration bed
is where the water is moved where the natural process bacteria eat
all solids. The wastewater then flows to a final clarifier where a
floc forms from the solids, and settles to the bottom of the
clarifier where a sludge digestor takes it away. All the solids taken
away decompose to form a sludge that is used in nearby farming lands.

water is taken to the gravity filters and 98% of the remaining TSS
and BOD are removed (Water Systems of Conway). The water is then
disinfected to kill any remaining bacteria and discharged to the
receiving stream of Stone Dam Creek. All this is provided by</P>
