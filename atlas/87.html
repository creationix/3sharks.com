<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>	Arkansas is located in a region
known as the &#147;Bible Belt&#148;.  Like anywhere else in the
United States there are many religions located here in Arkansas.  How
did these religions get here and what religions did they displace? 
Religion is a very important thing in Arkansas and throughout the
South as it is in other countries.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>Over the years there has been many
debates over what defines a religion and what should be accepted as a
religion.  With the understanding that the United States was founded
on Christian doctrine, one would assume that Christianity would be
the most favored religion, but that is changing.  In the United
States &#147;it is becoming more difficult to acknowledge that our
culture was shaped by Christianity&#148; (Whitman).  The United
States is a &#147;melting pot&#148; and invited into this &#147;blending
mixture&#148; is every kindred and tribe that wishes to escape
religious persecution and/or claim a better life for themselves. 
Although the United States is considered to be such, it has a region
that spans from coast to coast known as the &#147;Bible Belt&#148;.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
religious movement was a time when people were becoming fed up with
the old &#147;Church of England&#148;.  The influence of the Church
of England (Anglican Church) was diminishing mainly because the
church was no longer in tune with the people&#146;s needs.  The
common people saw the Anglican Church associated with &#147;
dry-as-dust sermons, lackadaisical piety, and the fopperies of the
tidewater society&#148;, which were quickly becoming something of the
past (Boles 1).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>	New
denominations such as the Baptist, and Methodist were rapidly gaining
momentum as well as local popularity and support.  The major belief
of these three were that Jesus was the son of God, that all
&#147;Christians&#148; should try to help each other, and that it was
their duty to spread the Gospel, the teachings of Christ (Boles 1).
The Baptist Church believed that the believer should be immerged in
water, or baptized, after receiving Jesus (Lehigh). Methodist
churches denounced five of the sacraments of the Catholic church and
believed that the only two that were necessary were baptism and
partaking in &#147;the Lord&#146;s Supper,&#148; or communion (UMC). </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
Baptist, and Methodist were founded in the United States sometime in
the early 1700&#146;s.  Most of the time these three denominations
were started on the East coast mainly due to the fact that people
were immigrating from Europe to the United States.  Being on the
coast it was just more convenient to settle in the East.  The decades
following the American Revolution kind of changed everything.  With
war behind them, settlers began to search for God once again.  This
was the beginning of the &#147;Great Revival&#148;.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>The Great Revival swept through
the South during the early portion of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century
converting every neighborhood in the South.  The revival is believed
to have begun in the Cumberland region of Kentucky.  From there,
trained evangelists from the East worked their way throughout much of
South converting people to Christianity.  </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>Frontier life was harsh, and
people were starved for something, anything that would free them from
their primitive and boring life.  Historians believe that this time
period was perfect for a religious movement to sweep through the
nation.  There was a decline in Indian attacks, the loneliness of
thinly settled pioneer families, and the constant nearness of death
helped to push this religious revolution through the South.  </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>Through the past 100 years of
Arkansas history, religion has been affected by many factors but
immigration had the most to do with its change.  When immigrants
entered into the U.S. they either accepted the beliefs of most
Americans or they were against their beliefs because they already had
their own religion.  The immigrants were mainly scared to change the
way that they ran their normal life.   The majority of them accepted
the American religions.  A survey was run around the Conway, Arkansas
district in the 1925 to find out how religion and country life was
(Appendix 1).  The majority of the people, which were in some
religion, were Methodist. What the survey didn&#146;t show was the
amount of influences that immigrants had on the state.  Today, ten
percent of all Americans&#151;27 million&#151;were born in a foreign
nation (Whitman).  Through out the next several decades&#146;
different cultures moved into Arkansas and other religions changed. 
The Methodist Episcopal Church in southern Arkansas fought against
all sort of immigration in Arkansas in the 1920&#146;s because they
were afraid that immigrants would change the way people think.  The
church was more afraid of the different beliefs that immigrants would
bring to Arkansas.  During this time, Arkansas was split in two. The
North Arkansas Conference controlled all of the rich farms and the
northeastern mountains. The South Arkansas Conference controlled the
rest of the state&#146;s land.  The Methodist Episcopal Church was
right in the center of this and they took their religious arguments
to the courts.  The majority of these arguments were to restrict
immigrants form getting into Arkansas.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>	Religions
formed mostly by starting in one place and moving into another.  This
is called spatial diffusion, when one idea originates in a place and
then spread out to other places.  Various religions move all around
the world by different forms of communication and movement.  Nearly
all religions came into Arkansas by the people who originally settled
here.  This is also referred to as migration.  The people migrated
from other countries, bringing their own religions, and converting
other settlers.  Religions then formed as a result of people adopting
beliefs and ideas.  Today only 12 percent of Americans claim to be
any other religion besides Christianity.  Arkansas has a very large
number of Baptists and Methodists.  These religions formed under
Christianity.  </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>Religion is spread by two type of
spatial diffusion.  Relocation and contiguous.  Contiguous diffusion
is when something occurs from one place directly to a neighboring
place.  The denominations of Baptist, and Methodist were spread all
the way from Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maine to southern regions
like Georgia, Kentucky, and of course Arkansas by contiguous
diffusion.  Because technology was rather primitive during the late
1700&#146;s the only way news could travel was person to person and
neighbor to neighbor.  The lack of technology during this time caused
a large measurment of friction of distance for religion, which
limited long distance interactions.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>Christianity emerged from Judaism.
 Judaism was developed in Israel.  The beliefs and practices were
changed and turned into Christianity in Egypt.  From there it
diffused to Ethiopia, and was established in India by the second
century.  It then spread northeast to Armenia, which became the first
Christian nation by the early fourth century.  By the end of the
fourth century, Christianity became the Roman Empire&#146;s official
religion.  Chrisitainity became the official religion after the
emperor was converted to Christianity and enforced it onto the
people.  Christianity then spread all over Europe and left with
migrants to North America.  Christianity diffused rapidly and now
covers nearly all the Western Hemisphere.  Christianity became so
prominent along the Southeastern part of the United States that it is
referred to as the &#147;Bible Belt&#148;.  Arkansas is part of this
belt and predominantly Christian.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>Judaism is also a religion found
in Arkansas.  It&#146;s bases is on a covenant established between
God, Abraham, and Abraham&#146;s descendants. It developed in Israel
of the Middle East and through relocation diffusion, or diffusion
that occurs through migration,  it came to be in the United States. 
Judaism is not spread but instead you are born Jewish.  Although the
majority of Jewish people live in New York and California, there are
Jewish people living in Arkansas.  Judaism was mainly brought to
Arkansas by migration from other states in the United States.  </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>Religions derived from
Christianity are the different sects or denominations, such as
Methodist, Baptist, and Catholics.  Many non-denominational churches
are founded with beliefs similar to other religions.  These churches
are formed because they share some of the religions&#146; beliefs and
ideas, but disagree with many important ones.  For example, Southern
Pentecostal churches are derived from the original Pentecostal
religion.  They have almost the same beliefs, but Southern
Pentecostals don&#146;t agree with the strict rules of Pentecostals. 
Southern Baptists are also like Baptists, but they are more
charismatic.  Many religions are derived from other religions because
of slight belief differences. 	Television and the internet also
introduce religions to society by reducing the friction of distance,
or cost of getting information from one place to another, between
them.  Many new age religions, such as Wiccan and Paganism, are found
on the internet.  Television helps to spread some religious beliefs,
especially Christianity because T.V. stations broadcast Christian
church services.  People can learn about different religions by using
these forms of technology, but the main way religion is spread is by
migration and people introducing new beliefs and churches. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>One&#146;s religion is determined
by their engagement in what they believe to be a spiritual reality. 
In Arkansas the predominate belief system is Christianity, but it is
not the only religious practice that takes place.  The capital of
Arkansas has been described as the &#147;meditation and practice
center&#148; for up to five Buddhist traditions (Pruitt).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>Religion has always had the
ability to shape the structure of society.  In some cases, it causes
people to be loving and accepting of weaker citizens, while in other
cases religion can cause an up-rising of genocide or &#147;ethnic
cleansing&#148;.  It can cause some people to show forward generous
love while causing others to demonstrate a brutal hatred.  In
Arkansas religion played a part in the abolishment of slavery and in
the women's rights campaign (Robinson).  </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Christianity is a
dominant religion, can Arkansas be looked at as mono-religious? 
There are many ways that you can look at or ask if Arkansas is
mono-religious.  When one first thinks about it, one would say of
course not because there is more than one religion in Arkansas.  But
with a second thought, one relizes that Arkansas could be
mono-religious.  A New Yorker, which has grown up to see there are
many different lifestyles and religions, may see Arkansas as a &#147;Lord
Jesus&#148; state being in the middle of the &#147;Bible Belt&#148;. 
If you are not in any form of Christianity in Arkansas then you are
looked at differently by about 70-80% of the state&#146;s population.
 While it doesn&#146;t really matter if you are Baptist, Methodist,
Catholic or Jewish, if it does not involve Jesus in Arkansas then it
is looked down upon.  </FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#330033"><FONT SIZE=3>The dominant religions in Arkansas
all have the same major ideas.  Jesus Christ died for the sins of
mankind, or the ticket to heaven is accepting Jesus as your personal
savior.  Some put money into missions while others use it to expand
their ministry.  Although they have the same basic beliefs about
Jesus, they may believe that you can or can not lose your salvation. 
It is the same religion with just a different style.  </FONT></FONT>
