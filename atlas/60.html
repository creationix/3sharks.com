</span>Instead, it is revealed in the presence of a rift valley, which is
dropped through in the plate rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Volcanic activity weakens the plates and forms rifts in the plates.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The New Madrid Rift, also known as the
Reelfoot Rift, was formed 500 million years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Existing twenty-five miles below the surface, it is considered a
“failed” rift because a successful one would have eventually split the
plate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore, it is actually a zone
of seismic activity (Stewart and Knox 1995).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This zone begins in Cairo, Illinois and extends 150 miles to Marked Tree,
Arkansas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Besides crossing five states,
it crosses the Mississippi River three times.</p>

earthquakes in eight categories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They
are tiny, very minor, minor, light, moderate, strong, major, and great.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tiny earthquakes range from 1.0 to 1.9 on
the Richter scale and occur once every two days.<span style="mso-spacerun:

scale and occur once every two weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>These two earthquakes are unfelt and detected only by instruments.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then comes the earthquakes that are felt,
but cause little or no damage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are
the minor earthquakes, which measure 3.0 to 3.9 and occur once every<span

which occur once every four years measure 4.0 to 4.9.<span style="mso-spacerun:

California, which are destructive, but not devastating.<span

the Richter scale and occur once every four decades.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Occurring once every eight decades, strong earthquakes measuring
6.0 to 6.9.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lastly, the most
devastating earthquakes are the majors and greats.<span style="mso-spacerun:

magnitude is the New Madrid earthquake of 1811-1812.<span style="mso-spacerun:

occur once every two centuries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

every five centuries and range from 8.0 to 8.9 on the Richter scale (Stewart

the river banks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This fifth shock explained
the real cause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wherever the veins of
the earthquake ran, there was a volcanic discharge of constable matter to a
great height, as incessant rumbling was heard below, and the bed of the river
was excessively agitated, whilst the water assumed a turbid and boiling
appearance- near our boat a spout of confined air, breaking its way through the
waters burst forth and with a loud report discharged mud, sticks &amp;c, from
the rivers bed, at least thirty feet above the surface (Fuller 1996).”</p>

little jerks and spasms continued for several days. Then on February 17, at

8.8 on the Richter scale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is

Quebec at 3:19 a.m.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the people in
Australia had had seismographs, they would have recorded it 33 minutes after
the initial eruption.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sand boiled along
