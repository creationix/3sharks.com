<h2>The Disease and Decline of the Bald Eagle</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A mysterious
diseased caused the Bald Eagle to come close to the extinction level.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This disease spread in several southern
states.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It affects the cerebella
portion of the brain, which controls the automatic body functions such as
balance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like multiple sclerosis in
humans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The myclin or “insulation”
surrounding the nerves is stripped off because of the holes that are
formed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The greatest threat to the bald
eagles existence arose after the wide spread use of DDT after World War II.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>DDT is a
chlorinated hydrocarbon with a low solubility in water and has a tendency to
chemically attach to soil particles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
was originally thought to be safe to humans and the environment but later it
was discovered to accumulate in the environment but later it was discovered to accumulate
in the environment and build up to toxic concentrations in food chains (<a
href="http://pmep.)/">http://pmep.)</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>DDT was sprayed on croplands throughout the country and it residues
washed into lakes and streams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There,
aquatic plants and small animals that were eaten by fish absorbed them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The contaminated fish, in turn, were eaten
by the bald eagles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>DDT interfered with
the bald eagle’s ability to develop strong shells for its eggs.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result, bald eagles and many other bird
species began laying eggs with shells so thin they often broke during
incubation or failed to hatch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
disrupted their reproduction and the population plummeted.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The start of the banning of DDT began in
1972 (<a href="http://www.fws)/">http://www.fws)</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>DDT is considered as the pesticide as the pesticide of the
greatest historical significance, due to its effect on the environment,
agriculture, and human health.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ban
of DDT was final on January 1, 1973.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officially canceled all uses
of DDT (<a href="http://micro)/">http://micro)</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
discovery of this disease was not easy to find.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>An associate professor of wildlife ecology at Arkansas State
University tagged 14 eagles this year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>His group studied the Eagle’s eating habits from observations in the
field and from the eagles droppings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Their findings were that a short stay at any lake may reduce the toxin
intake because the shorter the stay, the exposure to the toxin was
lessened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lake Degray is the likeliest
source of the toxin in Arkansas and Lake Ouchita is the eagles number one
destination after Lake Degray (<a href="http://www.tws)/">http://www.tws)</a>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Scientists ruled out bacteria, viruses and
parasites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The three main microscopic
organisms that are known to affect birds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the winter of 1994-95, 29 bald eagles died at DeGray Lake in
Southwest Arkansas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This set off an
environmental alarm (<a href="http://proquest)/">http://proquest)</a>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the next page is a graph of total bald
eagle death statistics in Arkansas from 1994-98.<span style="mso-spacerun:

the past four years (<a href="http://www.aristotle)/">http://www.aristotle)</a>.<span

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The bald
Eagle’s increasing population despite the negative out look for the bald eagle
existence they have managed to come back from the brink of extinction.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The good news about the bald eagles is that
their populations are up and are continued to rise (<a
href="http://www.defenders)/">http://www.defenders)</a>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1994 efforts to save the endangered
species reached a milestone with the announcement by the U.S. and Wildlife
Services that the bald eagle had recovered sufficiently to change its status
from endangered to threatened in most parts of the nation (<a
href="http://www.agfc)/">http://www.agfc)</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A recovery method, as well as habitat improvement and the banning of
DDT, has made this change possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Bald eagle numbers in the lower 48 states climbed from 417nesting pairs
in 1963 to more than 4,000 pairs in 1994.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In addition, 5,000 to 6,000 juvenile bald eagles live in the lower 48
states.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Federal protection and
tremendous support led to this recovery through stricter law enforcement,
protection of important habitat, reintroduction a strong public education
program and the primary reason for the continued survival was the banning of
the pesticide DDT (Anonymous).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While
habitat loss still remains a threat to the bald eagle’s full recovery, most
experts agree that its recovery to date is encouraging.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Soon the bald eagle in Arkansas will be a
common sight for Arkansasans to see soaring the skies (<a

the progression or the bald eagle’s population is on the rise DeGray Lake Task
Force, with staff members of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, U.S. Army
corps of Engineers, and DeGray lake Resort State Park, continued to deep a
close eye on the eagle population at the lake, but so far has found no definite
cause for the problems (Game and Fish Commission).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The bald

</span>The “Endangered” list means that a species is considered in danger of
extinction throughout all or significant portion of its range, while “
threatened” is a less dire category, meaning a species is considered likely to
become endangered, but not in danger of extinction. The bald eagles progress is
an endangered species will continue through annual surveys and bird
banding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Continuing education on this
subject will also help to increase the population.<span style="mso-spacerun:

more common by soon soaring the skies of Arkansas (McClelland).</p>
