<P>Research Question:  Death. Everyone in Arkansas does it. But from what do the people in          this state die? Have the major causes of death changed over time? How? Are there major differences in cause of death by age, sex or race?<FONT SIZE=2> </P>

<P>&#9;Death is something that happens to everyone.  The majority of Arkansans die from heart disease (31.3%). Whether related to age, sex or race, it is a major killer that effects our society. Though it is a major cause, heart disease is not the only thing Arkansans die from. Statistics from the 1996 edition of Arkansas Mortality shows the five leading causes of death to be heart disease (31.3%), malignant neoplasms (22.5%), cerebrovascular diseases (8.6%), accidents (4.8%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.2%).  But how have these causes changed over time and how are they affected by age, sex, and race?  These are the questions we are about to tackle.</P>
<P>&#9;In the United States as well as in Arkansas, death rates have undergone a &quot;mortality revolution&quot;.  Starting around 1860, death rates and birth rates began declining.  This was an epidemiological transition, which echoed the demographic transition.  An epidemiological transition is the change of formerly fatal epidemic diseases into conditions continual within populations that develop partial immunity to them.  People began developing these partial immunities and deaths associated with these diseases declined.  For example people began becoming immune to malaria, typhoid fever, and small pox, so deaths related to these diseases decreased.  However, deaths related to cancer and AIDS, and other incurable diseases, have increased.</P>
<P>&#9;Improvement in animal husbandry, crop rotation, and other agricultural practices had an affect on the level of health in a positive way.  The implementation of sewage systems and sanitary water supplies in larger cities also affected the declining death rates.  Because of these various improvements in agricultural and sanitation, mortalities due to infectious, parasitic, and respiratory disease and to malnutrition decreased.  However, deaths related to chronic illnesses associated with an aging population increased (Getis, Getis, and Fellmann pp207, 208).  So you see, death is changing just as the population and technology changes.</P>
<P>Of the 26,526 Arkansas deaths in 1996, 337 were infants, representing 1.3% of the total deaths. One-fourth (24.9%) of the residents deaths were 85 or older (Arkansas Mortality Statistics, 1996).  Among males ages 1 to 24, the leading cause of death was accidents and adverse effects.  Among females ages 1 to four, the leading cause of death was congenital abnormality. For females between the ages of 5 and 24, accidents and adverse effects were the leading causes of death. Among the 25-44 year old females, the leading cause of death was malignant neoplasms, while accidents and adverse effects continued to top the list for males. Malignant neoplasms remain the leading cause of death among females ages 45-64. By the time males reach this age category, however, malignant neoplasms and diseases of the heart have surpassed accidents and adverse effects as the leading cause of death for both males and females age 65 and over. </P>
<P>Radical differences appear among 15-24 year olds, however. Homicide and legal intervention is the leading cause of death for 15-24 year old non-whites, due to homicides among young non-white males. The mortality rate due to homicide and legal intervention among non-white males declined substantially in 1996, however. It dropped from a rate of 143.6 per 100,000 population in 1995 to a rate of 118.0 in 1996. This rate still executed by far the rate of 6.5 for white males the same age.  Homicides among non-</P>
<P>White females, 15-24, also dropped in 1996 and for the first time since 1990 were surpassed by other causes as the leading cause of death.  &#9;</P>
<P>Accidents and adverse effects tops the list as the leading cause of death in white males. Among the 15-24 year old white males, the mortality rate from accidents and adverse effects rose from 84.9 in 1995 to 100.9 in 1996. This rate is higher than that of same aged white females (35.6) or same aged non-white males (64.1).  The majority of these deaths (72.1%) were a result of motor vehicle accidents, although a rise in the mortality rate appears largely due to a rise in other accidents and adverse effects. Suicide ranked as the second leading cause of death among white males ages 15-24 with a rate of 37.5. </P>
<P>The leading causes of death among people’ age 65 and older were diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms, which together accounted for 56.3% of the white and 54.8% of the non-white deaths. The death rate for the United States is 875.4 deaths per 100,000 population. The comparable rate in Arkansas is 1099.1, 25.6%, which is higher than the national rate in 1996. When age adjusted, however, the Arkansas rate of 559.5 is only 13.4% higher than the U.S. rate of 493.6 (this is equivalent to a ratio of 1.13 to 1).</P>
<P>The Arkansas age adjusted rate exceeded the U.S. rate for each of the following causes of death (by decreasing ratio): accidents and adverse effects (1.52), cerebrovascular disease (1.36), heart disease (1.11), pneumonia and influenza (1.10), malignant neoplasms (1.08) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.05). The 1996 age adjusted mortality rate for Arkansas males was 730.0. White female rate was 419.3. </P>
<P>Although these are higher than the rates for the U.S. (626.7 and 382.3) the male and female ratio is very similar (1.74 versus 1.64) as in 1996. </P>
<P>The race of a person can, in some instances, contribute to the death of that person. According to the statistics listed in Emerge magazine, black people in the United States have a higher mortality rate than white people in 13 of the 15 leading causes of death (Curry, 1998). The fact that black Americans make up only 13% of the entire United States population make those figures seem almost overwhelming. Some Scientists believe that this is because white people have benefited more that black people from many social and medical improvements, including improvements in the preventing of childhood disease and other diseases that strike at a young age (Edmondson, 1997).  Black males in the U.S. have the highest rate of prostate cancer in the world.  Also black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than are white women. Unbelievably, a black child born to a woman with a college degree, has a greater chance of dying than does a white child born to a woman with less than a high school education (Curry, 1998). Black people are also at greater risk for AIDS. Black women are eight times more likely to contract the AIDS virus than are white women; they have three times a greater risk than do Latinos at contracting AIDS. Approximately half of all women in the United States who have AIDS are black, and those numbers are growing still (Fears, 1998). Blacks also face two times a greater chance of dying from strokes and diabetes than do white people. The chances of a black baby becoming sick before or right after birth are three times as high as white babies (Fears, 1998). One might ask why exactly black people are more likely to die of health causes. Studies show that white people have benefited significantly more than black people from a host of social and medical improvements made throughout the years. This fact is seen most in the area of childhood diseases. The life expectancy of a white baby at birth is seven years longer than the life expectancy of a black baby at birth. </P>
<P>As people get older this number drops steadily.  The life expectancy of a white person is five years and ten months longer than a black person at the age of 25, three years longer at the age of forty five, and one month longer at the age of eighty five (Edmondson, 1997). However, medical causes are not the only factors that contribute to a higher mortality rate in black people. A black person is seven times more likely than a white person to be murdered (Fears, 1998). </P>
<P>&#9;Now that the statistics of black and white people have been discussed, we will take a look at some statistics for Hispanics.  Hispanics make up approximately 10% of the United States population, and account for four percent of the deaths in the United States annually (Edmondson, 1997). Hispanics have a lower chance of a number of medical problems including the following: cancer, heart disease, suicide and motor vehicle accidents. However, Hispanics are more likely to die from the following: pneumonia, influenza, cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes and homicide (Edmondson, 1997). The fact that most Hispanics live in a state of poverty does impact their overall death rates. Hispanic children, because they cannot afford to be immunized, are more likely than white people and black people to catch preventable diseases (Edmondson, 1997). Despite the poverty level, in most Hispanic homes, there is one thing that studies show help to improve the health of Hispanics. That one thing is the strong family ties and support found in most Hispanic homes. Research suggests that these family ties do, in fact, speed the recovery processes of Hispanics (Edmondson, 1997).</P>
<P>As shown here, income seems to play a major part in mortality rates, as do social </P>
<P>interaction. However, these two things should not be singled out. There are a number of factors affecting the death rates among the races.</P>
<P>While there are numerous other contributing factors to a person’s death, race does, in some instances, determine how and when the person will die.  The Arkansas Department of Health {ADH} annually publishes interesting statistics concerning race and death in our state.  Because the percentage of non-white people that are black that die is incredibly high (98.2% in 1996), the ADH does not include a &quot;other non-white&quot; column in its statistics.  A look at these statistics shows that the rates of death and reasons of death for both white and non-white people seem to have both similarities and differences.</P>
<P>Over the course of the year in 1996, 26,526 Arkansans were killed by differing causes.  Of those 26,526 deaths, eighty-five percent (22,563) were white and only fifteen percent (3,960) were non-white.  Of the 3,960 people that were non-white, 3,889 were black (Mortality in Arkansas: 1996).  One reason for such an extreme number of white deaths is the fact that white people make up approximately 82.2% of Arkansas’ population, while non-white people make up only about 17.8% of the population.  Of that 17.8% of non-white people, about 15.9% are black (Mortality in AR: 1996).</P>
<P>The top four leading causes of death among both whites and non-whites are the same.  The number one cause of death among both white and non-white people in Arkansas is &quot;diseases of the heart&quot; (Mortality in Arkansas: 1996).  Of the 22,563 white people that died in 1996, 7,183 (31.8%) of them died from a disease of the heart.  Of the 3,960 black people that died in 1996, 1,127 (28.5%) were killed by a disease of the heart.  The second leading cause of death among both whites and non-whites in Arkansas is &quot;malignant neoplasms,&quot; which is and abnormal growth (such as a tumor) that is likely to cause death (Mortality in Arkansas: 1996).  Malignant neoplasms were responsible for 5,157 (22.9%) of the total white deaths in Arkansas in 1996.  They were also responsible for 803 (20.3%) of the total non-white death in Arkansas in 1996 ( Mortality in Arkansas: 1996).  The third leading cause of death for both white and non-white people in Arkansas is &quot;cerebrovascular diseases,&quot; which is a disease of the brain.  Of the total white people that died in 1996, 1,948 (8.6%) died from a cerebrovascular disease.  Of the total non-white people that died in 1996, 345 (8.7%) died form a cerebrovascular disease ( Mortality in Arkansas: 1996).  The fourth and final leading cause of death that is the same for both white and non-white people in Arkansas is &quot;accidents and adverse effects.&quot;  Accidents and adverse effects claimed the lives of 1,039 (4.6%) of the 22,563 white people killed in 1996. Of the 4.6% that died from this cause, 2.4% were involved in a motor vehicle accident.  Accidents and adverse effects also claimed the lives of 225 (5.7%) of the total non-white population that died in 1996.  Of that 5.7%, 2.7% were involved in a motor vehicle accident (Mortality in Arkansas: 1996).  While the top four leading causes of death among white and non-white people are the same, the remaining causes differ in rank.</P>
<P>&#9;Among white people, the fifth leading cause of death is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (diseases of the lungs), which claimed 1,030 (4.6%) of the total lives lost in 1996 in Arkansas.  The sixth leading cause of death for white people in 1996 was Pneumonia and Influenza, which took 833 (3.7%0 of the total lives lost.  The seventh leading cause of death for white people is Diabetes Mellitus, a disease characterized by excess sugar in the blood and urine.  Diabetes Mellitus was the cause of death for 443 (2.0%) of the 22,563 white people that died in Arkansas in 1996.  The eighth leading cause of death for white people is suicide, which accounted for 295 (1.3%) of the deaths of white people in 1996.  The ninth leading cause of death for white people is Septicemia, which is blood poisoning.  Septicemia accounted for 291 (1.3%) for the total deaths of white people in Arkansas in 1996. The tenth leading cause of death among white people in Arkansas is Nephritis and Nephrosis, diseases of the kidneys.  These two diseases claimed the lives of 289 (1.3%) of the total number of white people that died in Arkansas in 1996 ( Mortality in Arkansas: 1996).</P>
<P>Among non-white people in Arkansas, the causes are almost all the same, just in a different rank.  The fifth leading cause of death among non-white people in Arkansas in 1996 was Diabetes Mellitus, which took 135 (3.4%) lives of the 3,960 lost.  The sixth leading cause of death among non-white people is homicide and legal intervention, which claimed 124 (3.1%) lives of the total lost.  The seventh leading cause of death among non-white people in Arkansas is Pneumonia and Influenza, which killed 111 (2.8%), of the total lives lost.  The eighth leading cause of death among non-white people in Arkansas is Septicemia, which took 87 (2.2%) of the total non-white people killed in 1996 in Arkansas.  The ninth leading cause of death among non-white people in Arkansas is Nephritis and Nephrosis.  These two diseases killed 86 (2.2%) of the 3,960 non-white people in Arkansas is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, which killed in Arkansas in 1996 (Mortality in Arkansas: 1996).</P>
<P>The rankings or the leading causes of death have changed since previous years. For example, from 1992 to 1995, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases surpassed accidents and adverse effects as the fourth leading cause of death among white people.  Also, in previous years, homicide has been the fifth leading cause of death among non-whites.  However, in 1996, homicide was surpassed by Diabetes Mellitus.  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease was the seventh leading cause of death among non-whites in previous years, but dropped to tenth in 1996 (Mortality in Arkansas: 1996). As one can see, the leading causes of death are affected by many factors and are constantly changing.</P>
<P>&#9;In comparing the mortality rates of two different years:  1987 and 1996, we discovered that Arkansan males suffered more residential deaths than females.  What do we mean by residential deaths?  A residential death is one in which a resident of Arkansas dies.  In 1987 there were 24,431 deaths in Arkansas.  Of these deaths, 13,227   were men and 11,204 were women.  This is a difference of 2,023 deaths (Mortality in Arkansas: 1987).  Thus it can be inferred that men were more likely to die than women in 1987.  In 1996 there were 26,526 deaths of Arkansas residents.  The difference between males and females that year was only 746.  The male population suffered a total of 13, 636 deaths, while the female population suffered a total of 12,890 deaths (Mortality in Arkansas: 1996).  During the nine year span between 1987 and 1996, there seems to be an increase in the number of female deaths.</P>
<P>According to <U>Mortality in Arkansas: 1987,</U> the leading causes of death for men in 1987 were as follows:</P>

<P>According to <U>Mortality in Arkansas:1996</U>, the top two leading causes of death in 1996 were heart disease and malignant neoplasms.  It seems that the majority of men and women die from the same types of diseases in Arkansas.  It begins to vary as we go through the list of causes.  For example, women are more prone to die from complications of childbirth and men are more likely to die by use of firearms.  </P>
<P>Death is something that happens to everyone, specifically everyone in Arkansas.  As noted before, the majority of Arkansans die from heart disease (31.3%). Though it is a major cause, heart disease is not the only thing Arkansans die from. The next four leading causes of death are malignant neoplasms (22.5%), cerebrovascular diseases (8.6%), accidents (4.8%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.2%).  We have hopefully shown by our research that the causes of death of changed over time.  Mortality has changed with the changing population and technology.  And hopefully we have shown that death is associated with age, race, and sex.  The reason why certain ages, races, and sexes suffer more deaths than others is still unknown…we will leave that for you to research!!  Have fun with your continuing journey into the world of demographics.</P>
