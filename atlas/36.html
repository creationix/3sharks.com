understand how spatial behavior is connected with a college, we must first
define spatial behavior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>According to <u>Introduction
to Geography, </u><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>spatial behavior is
the movement, spread, and arrangement of things on the earth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Spatial behavior encompasses many things
including diffusion, distribution, and interaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Things or people interact and spread in many aspects of our world
and specifically on a college campus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This paper will cover three specific areas that are connected to spatial
behavior here at the University of Central Arkansas.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>First, we will look at the accessibility of public places to the
disabled here on campus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Second, we
will explore the use of signs to identify buildings and display information.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And third, we will cover the migration of
football players and coaches from their homes to the University here in Conway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

accessibility of public places to the disabled.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Two questions that will be covered are as follows:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Is the UCA campus in full compliance with
the Disabilities Act?” and “Is the entire campus accessible to the disabled?”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

goal of the people in the office is to “provide access to all programs and
reasonable accommodations to qualified students” (Holbrook 1).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A qualified person is someone with or
without accommodation that has met the requirements of eligibility for
admission to UCA and can perform the basic requirements of a particular field
of study.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The coordinator, Wendy
Holbrook, pointed out that it is the responsibility of the student to notify
the University of any Disability or disabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>These include the following disabilities: mobility impairment,
visual impairment, hearing impairment, or learning disability.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Students are required to provide

than classroom accommodations, how accessible is the entire campus at UCA for
the disabled?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was only one way to
find out, firsthand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because evaluating
the entire campus was nearly impossible, we included our observations of
parking and four major buildings on campus: Torreyson Library, Old Main, the
student center, and Christian Cafeteria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

posted in front of each space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do not
try to park in any space marked like these unless your vehicle is designated
for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Doing so could and most likely
will result in a $50.00 ticket, courtesy of the UCA Police Department.<span

disabled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A ramp with a relatively even
grade is located out front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The doors
are electrically opened at specific entrances and are operational at the push
of a clearly marked button.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Elevators
are located inside and are large enough for wheelchairs to maneuver in and out
of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The computer lab even has
specialized desks that are made for a person in a wheelchair.<span

accessible for wheelchairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It must be
pointed out that due to the old age of the building, certain compliance to the
Disabilities Act does not have to be met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

Services on campus, calls the “grandfather clause.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the signs were posted at eye level, making your way around campus would be
easier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also, if the signs were a
contrasting color to the color of the building, they would stand out much
more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This would improve maneuvering
around campus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The buildings are dimly

of Central Arkansas is not the easiest place to get around due to
inconspicuously marked buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

the campus easier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also, better maps

<h3>Spatial Diffusion: Migration of Football Players and Coaches</h3>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The last topic to be discussed dealing with spatial
behavior at UCA concerns the migration of players and coaches on the UCA
football team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Patterns of migration
seem to be similar year to year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From
1994 to 1998, UCA recruited high school athletes, junior college and division
one and two transfers that were mostly from the state of Arkansas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nearly 70% of recruits come from this
state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The remaining 30% percent of
athletes come from states including:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Tennessee, California, Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Florida, Arizona,
Illinois, and New Mexico (East).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Distinct migration streams
in Arkansas are mainly from the central region of the state.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thirty-one recruits hail from central
Arkansas, nineteen come from northern Arkansas, and sixteen come from southern
Arkansas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The UCA coaches have personal
contacts with high schools such as Conway, Morrilton, Siloam Springs, North
Little Rock, Benton, and Lake Hamilton.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The number of junior college
transfers that have signed with UCA in the last four years tallies to
sixteen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The number of division one and
two transfers that UCA has signed in the last four years totals twelve.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These schools include Rutgers, Arkansas
State, Mississippi State, and the University of Nevada-Las Vegas (East ).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In the past four years,
coaches have come and gone, but we have had only one head coach.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Coach Mike Isom is a graduate of Conway High
School(East 8).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This common tie
obviously aids in recruitment from Conway High School.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This bond also is likely partly responsible
for the longevity of his stay here at UCA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The University has seen two defensive coordinators, two offensive
coordinators, and six different assistant coaches.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Mark Hudspeth, defensive back coach from Mississippi, is
instrumental in drawing a few athletes to UCA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This is according to reports from various players who had previously
known of Hudspeth’s coaching tactics and personality before coming to UCA.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A map of the United States is attached and
has the states that recruits, transfers, and coaches are from highlighted
(figure 2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Conclusion:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In conclusion, we have defined spatial
behavior and have shown some various areas that are encompassed by it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Accessibility to the disabled, signs and
buildings, and migration of football players and coaches are included in
spatial behavior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, spatial
behavior has a broad scope and is not limited just to these three areas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Spatial behavior encompasses a wide range of
topics and we encourage you to explore as many as possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
