<P>	The United States is currently undergoing unprecedented
demographic changes.  Due to immigration, which is the number one
cause of population change in the U.S.-not births and deaths, white
people will be in the minority by the middle of this century (Tilove
1998:1).  This is based on the current trend of immigration and would
be different if immigration were sharply curtailed; however, minority
populations would still have greatly increased by the year 2050
because immigrants tend to have higher birth rates than Americans
(Tilove 1998:2).  Although the number of Asian immigrants is an
important factor in considering these changes, Hispanics are the
fastest growing minority in America.  There are already more Hispanic
children than there are of other minorities, and by the year 2005
Hispanics will be the largest minority group (Vobejda 1998:1).  By
2050, the ethnic make-up of the U.S. will be 51% non-Hispanic white,
26% Hispanic, 14% black, and 8% Asian (Tilove 1998:2).  It is
important to note that &#147;Hispanic&#148; does not refer to race. 
According to the Census Bureau, a Hispanic is someone from Mexico,
Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central America, or South America (Green 1998:1). 
That includes a diverse range of races, cultural backgrounds, and
languages, although Spanish is the major one.  In the 1990 census
about half of Hispanics considered themselves racially white, while
about 40% classified themselves as racially &#147;other&#148; (Tilove
1998:2).  There are also African-American Hispanics (Cossman 1998:2).</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>	Arkansas has
seen a very significant increase in its Hispanic population in recent
years.  It leads the U.S. in Hispanic population growth rate, with a
127% increase since 1990 and raw numbers that exceeded predictions
for 2005 in 1998! (Green 1998:1).  About 25,000 Hispanics came to
Arkansas between 1990 and 1997, most of them going to the
northwestern part of the state (Green 1998:1, 2).  About 65% of
immigrants come because they already have immediate family here
(Editorial 1998:1).  Arkansas is seeing mainly secondary migration
where Hispanics who were already in the U.S., in places like
California or Texas, are coming to Arkansas.  This accounts for the
fact that only about 10% of Hispanics in Arkansas are illegal
immigrants (Cossman 2001:3).  Most Hispanics in Arkansas come from
either Mexico or Central America (Green 1998:1).  Figures from the
200 census show an even greater increase in Arkansas&#146; Hispanic
population, with county numbers ranging from 62 up to 13,469
(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://argis.ualr.edu/00_hpop_cty.pdf"><FONT SIZE=3>http://argis.ualr.edu/00_hpop_cty.pdf</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>)
and percent change ranging from 46.9 percent to 1,420.3 percent
(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://argis.ualr.edu/00_hpop_chg.pdf"><FONT SIZE=3>http://argis.ualr.edu/00_hpop_chg.pdf</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>).
 By looking more closely at economics and language, we can get a
better idea of what effects these increases may have on Arkansas in
the future.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>	It has been a commonly held view that immigrants take jobs away
from Americans, but is this really the case here in Arkansas? 
Hispanics are certainly coming here because of economic
opportunities, but are they doing it at the expense of Arkansans who
are already in the working force?  As noted earlier, the highest
concentration of Hispanic immigration is found in northwest Arkansas,
and there are economic reasons behind this.  The main draw is the
poultry industry, as demonstrated by the Tyson Corporation&#146;s
various efforts to improve its burgeoning Hispanic workforce with
English language and other programs (Kelley and Cossman 2000:10).  
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in">Another economic factor, besides just
jobs, is the Hispanics&#146; impact on health care.  That is one
important service that everyone needs, obviously, and, as Hispanics
become increasingly important to the work force, their health becomes
increasingly important (Kelly and Cossman 2000:9).  Health
professionals and patients are becoming quite frustrated as more
Hispanics seek health care it since it takes 2 to 3 times longer to
help them &#147;primarily because of translation issues, their lack
of familiarity with modern medical practice, terminology, and
individual medical histories&#148; (Kelly and Cossman 2000:7).</P>
<P>	Communication is a very important part of society, and language
barriers are huge barriers to the diffusion of menti-facts, which are
ideas, beliefs, philosophies, etc., and socio-facts, which are formal
and informal social institutions.  In order for enclaves, minorities
on the fringes of society such as newly arriving immigrants, to
become integrated, it is very important for such diffusion of ideas
to occur.  So, the assimilation of Hispanic immigrants hinges on
their either learning English or having vital information available
to them in Spanish.    
</P>
<P>This issue brings strong reactions at times since encountering
Spanish all over causes many Americans to feel as if the U.S. were
being transformed into a foreign land (Tilove 1998:1). Arkansas is
conscious of its rising Hispanic population. Publications for Spanish
speakers are available: <I>El Hispano</I> has been published in
Little Rock since 1995 and earlier this year, <I>El Latino</I>, a new
Spanish weekly published by the company that publishes <I>Arkansas
Times</I>, made its debut on Arkansas newsstands; newer Wal-Mart
stores carry <I>People</I> magazine in Spanish; and immigrants find
&#147;The Hispanic Newcomer&#146;s Guide to Pulaski County&#148;
useful (Kelly and Cossman 2000:7).   The Arkansas legislature has
also made recent attempts to encourage more Arkansas students to
learn Spanish.  A bill was introduced and passed by the state Senate
that would make it mandatory for all Arkansas high schools to offer
at least two years of Spanish.  Senator Jodie Mahony, who introduced
this bill, was promoting it on the basis that Arkansas would benefit
economically because of its proximity to Spanish speaking countries
and the increasing number of Spanish speakers within the state if
more Arkansans could speak Spanish (Osher 2001:1).  This bill did not
pass the House, however.  Opponents claimed that it would hurt
programs of other foreign languages and take control away from local
school districts (&#147;House Education Committee kills bill to favor
teaching Spanish in schools&#148; 2001:1). 
</P>
<P>The issue of Spanish in the public school systems is hotly debated
all over the country, wherever significant numbers of Spanish
speakers live. It is obvious that improvements in teaching Hispanic
children must be made since their national achievement test scores
are below average, and they are more likely to drop out of school
than their white peers (Zehr 2000:1).  The purpose of English as a
second language (ESL) programs is help children improve their
language proficiency to the point that they can attend all the
required classes, which are taught in English, without falling behind
(Stewart 2001:3). &#147;Much of the research says that it takes three
to four years for English competency to develop to such a level that
students can learn the content in English,&#148; said Emily de la
Cruz, an education professor at Portland State University (AP
2001:1).  Until they have the English skills, though, students learn
mainly in their native language (Breslau 2001:2).  The quicker
student move out of this bilingual instruction the better, but some
kids stay in it for six or seven years (Editorial 2001:1).  Critics
say that this is way too long and that this approach allows
Spanish-speaking children to stay in their comfort zone (AP 2001:1).
Although reforms limiting the time a student could remain in a
bilingual program have been proposed, opponents feel that children
would learn English much more quickly if they were totally immersed
in English.  Such immersion programs have already started in
California, which has resulted in better English reading
comprehension test scores among English learners (Breslau 2001:3).</P>
<P>  Educators in Arkansas have also found that English immersion is
most advantageous.  The Springdale school district has students in
its ESL program who speak Vietnamese and Laotian at home.  Since none
of the teachers speak these languages fluently, those children are
totally immersed in English at school, and, according to Patricia
Garcia, the ESL director there, they learn English more quickly than
the students who speak Spanish (Branam 2001:1).  St. Edward&#146;s
School, a Catholic private school in Little Rock that has had a
drastic increase in new Hispanic students in recent years, teaches
their ESL students in an English immersion environment in which they
learn the language quickly (Gillespie 2001:1).  The Rogers school
district is making plans to start a special intensive English school
for kids who are either new arrivals in the U.S. and have had no
exposure to English or ones who have already lived here for a time
but need special help.  This program would be for students in grades
6-12, but they are already talking about creating one for younger
children, too (Magsam 2001b:1).  
</P>
<P>	Just how successful have schools been at integrating students and
their parents into their new hometowns?  One Arkansas elementary
teacher has made some interesting observations.  Beth Adame, of
Dardanelle, said that the younger the students are, the more open
they are to acculturation, or the exchange of cultural ideas and
practices.  She noted, though, that older children, teenagers, and
adults are more prone to let cultural differences result in
misunderstandings, racial slurs, and even violence.  She said &#147;the
Mexican culture is so different from this culture that they often
tend to clash.&#148;  On the bright side, though, she has seen &#147;many
Mexicans embrace this culture and try their best to assimilate&#148;
(interview with Beth Adame 2001).  School administrators in northwest
Arkansas also want to help Hispanics become more integrated by
getting them more involved in their children&#146;s schools (Magsam
2001a:1).  Such parent-school participation is a very important
socio-fact and can help a lot with community unity.  The Rogers and
Springdale school districts are trying to hire more translators so
that they can communicate more easily with the parents who do not yet
speak very much English.  One school has even started a parent center
with adult English classes and parenting courses in Spanish (Magsam
2001b:1).  It seems like they really want to help the newcomers
become part of their communities.</P>
<P>	The influx of Hispanics into Arkansas has had a measurable impact
on almost every aspect of the state&#146;s society.  On the economic
front, Hispanics have come to Arkansas to take advantage of the
numerous jobs in the poultry and other industries.  In turn, health
care facilities and other providers of social services have been
forced to accommodate their needs.  The language barrier has also
been a notable source of impact with the immigration of Hispanics, as
those same social and health care services have had to solve the
problem of communication before even considering their capacity to
provide their services.  In addition, public schools have had to
accommodate the educational needs of Hispanic children.  By looking
at these two pivotal areas of society, along with the latest census
numbers regarding their population, we can see that Hispanics&#146;
influence on Arkansas can only increase in the future.</P>
