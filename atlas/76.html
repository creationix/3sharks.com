<P ALIGN=LEFT>Why are earthquakes in the East more destructive than

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>Earthquakes
are one of the Earth&#146;s most fascinating phenomenons.  Thousands
occur each day all over the world.  Even though people may not feel
them every time they occur, they still happen.  To have a better
understanding of earthquakes, an explanation about the plate
tectonics theory would help.  Alfred Wegener argues that many years
ago, the continents of the Earth were part of one large continent
called Pangea (Bergman and Renwick, 91).  This is shown in
Illustration I.  Illustration I shows the plates of the world
combined into one continent and the movement of the plates to form
separate continents.  Today, one huge continent does not exist
because the plates moved apart from each other, forming separate
continents. Illustration II shows the separated continents and labels
the Earth&#146;s plates.  Pangea may have occurred only one point in
time, but it shows how strong the force of convection is within the
Earth.  The force had to be strong enough to move the plates together
and then apart again.  </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>These
plates still move today by the force of convection.  Convection
occurs when a gas or liquid is heated, expands, and moves closer to
the cooler portion of the gas or liquid (Bergman and Renwick 47). 
The Earth&#146;s core is very hot.  The surface&#146;s temperature is
considerably cooler, so the heat rises up. This is due to the Earth&#146;s
need to equalize or find balance (Cossman).  Illustration III shows
the core of the Earth in relation to the crust or surface layer. The
mantle is a section in between the crust and the core made of rocks
(Roberts, 56). Convection is a result when the Earth was originally
formed and a result of radioactivity (Cossman). Convection causes the
movement of the plates, which produce earthquakes. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">An
explanation of how earthquakes occur will help create a better
understanding of all this.  Convection constantly pushes around the
plates of the Earth.  There are three different types of plate
movement.  One type is when two plates move apart from each other
(Lauber, 50).  This is called a divergent plate boundary (Bergman and
Renwick, 96).  A second type is when two plates meet (Lauber, 51). 
This type of movement is called a convergent plate boundary (Bergman
and Renwick, 96).  A third type of movement is when two plates move
past each other (Lauber, 51).  This is called a transform plate
boundary (Bergman and Renwick, 96). Subduction occurs when plates
move and one goes on top of another, which usually forms mountains
(Cossman).  Diversion occurs when plates pull apart from each other
and usually forms rift valleys (Cossman).  The movement of plates is
shown in Illustration IV. The place where the Earth&#146;s plates
move is called the focus (Bergman and Renwick, 91).  The area on the
surface above the focus is called the epicenter (Hodgson, 16).
Illustration V shows the focus and epicenter.  Hanging wall refers to
the rock above the fault, and footwall refers to the rock below the
fault (Yeats, 25).  Faults are explained a little later.  The depth
of the focus beneath the surface is the focal depth (Yeats, 25). 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">The
movement of plates causes stress on rocks (Bergman and Renwick, 97).
When the rocks are stressed far enough and fracture, it is called a
fault (Bergman and Renwick, 97).  Earthquakes also occur on faults
(Yeats, 24).  If the rock above the fault moves up or down, it is
called a dip-slip fault (Yeats, 25).  An example of a dip-slip fault
is the reverse fault in the San Fernando Valley in California (Yeats,
27).  If the rock moves parallel, it is called a strike-slip fault
(Yeats, 25).  An example of a strike-slip fault is the San Andreas
Fault in California.  &#147;There are two kinds of strike-slip fault,
right-lateral and left-lateral&#148; (Yeats, 25).  A right-lateral
strike-slip fault is when objects tend to move to the right during an
earthquake (Yeats, 25).  A left-lateral strike-slip fault is when
objects tend to move to the left during an earthquake (Yeats, 25).  A
normal fault is a type of dip-slip fault where the rock above the
fault moves down with respect to the rock below the fault (Yeats,
25). When the rock above the fault moves up with respect to the rock
below the fault, it is called a reverse fault (Yeats, 25). 
Researchers have named &#147;reverse faults that do not reach the
surface&#133;blind faults&#148; (Yeats, 25). Illustration VI shows
the plate movement during a normal fault, reverse fault, blind
reverse fault, right lateral strike-slip fault, and left lateral
strike-slip fault.

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">While the
plates are being pushed around, vibrations are sent up, which are
called earthquakes <FONT COLOR="#000000">(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://pubs.usgs.gov/"><FONT COLOR="#000000">http://pubs.usgs.gov/</FONT></A></U></FONT>).
 According to Roberts, &#147;the Earth&#146;s rocks are elastic,
being strong and rigid&#148; (102).  When they are struck by motion,
they vibrate.  Some vibrations are of low frequency while others are
high enough to be heard <FONT COLOR="#000000">(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://pubs.usgs.gov/"><FONT COLOR="#000000">http://pubs.usgs.gov/</FONT></A></U></FONT>).
&#147;When the rocks vibrate the motions become waves&#148; (Roberts,
102), and there are four types of waves.  The first type is a
compression wave.  Compression waves travel fast through the Earth
and are called primary or &#147;P&#148; waves
<FONT COLOR="#000000">(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://pubs.usgs.gov/"><FONT COLOR="#000000">http://pubs.usgs.gov/</FONT></A></U></FONT>).
 The second type is a transverse or shear wave.  It arrives later
<FONT COLOR="#000000">(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://pubs.usgs.gov/"><FONT COLOR="#000000">http://pubs.usgs.gov/</FONT></A></U></FONT>).
 The P wave is noticed as a &#147;sharp thud or blast-like shock&#148;
<FONT COLOR="#000000">(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://pubs.usgs.gov/"><FONT COLOR="#000000">http://pubs.usgs.gov/</FONT></A></U></FONT>).
 It causes particles to vibrate in lines (Roberts, 103).  An S wave
is noticed as &#147;a swaying or rolling motion&#148;
<FONT COLOR="#000000">(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://pubs.usgs.gov/">http://pubs.usgs.gov/</A></U></FONT>).
 It causes particles to vibrate from side to side (Roberts, 103). 
The third type is an &#147;L&#148; or Love wave.  L waves are much
longer than the other two waves.  They travel on the surface of the
Earth and move sideways in orbits (Roberts, 106).  A fourth type of
wave is the Rayleigh wave.  The Rayleigh wave is the most elaborate
of all and causes particles to move in vertical, circular paths
(Roberts, 108).   Three of the types of waves are described in
Illustration VII.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>The
method for classifying earthquakes is the Richter Scale (Golden, 46).
 It is used to compare the strength of earthquakes.  The magnitude of
an earthquake is known as the size or strength of an earthquake&#146;s
waves (Golden, 46) and the amount of energy released (Roberts, 148). 
The quakes are given a numeric value, for example a &#147;magnitude 3
quake is usually barely felt, magnitude 5 causes minor damage, and 6
or higher may lead to widespread destruction&#148; (Golden, 46). 
&#147;Each whole number represents a tenfold increase in wave size
over the previous number&#148; (Golden, 47).  For example, the waves
of a magnitude 7 quake are ten times that of a magnitude 6 quake
(Golden, 47).             </FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>
The quality of soil around an earthquake can have a large impact on
the damage done. When people think about the causes of deaths during
an earthquake, they tend to think of the shaking that causes
buildings to fall down and the destruction of other man -made
objects.  It is important to realize, however, that soil plays a
large role in the destruction caused by earthquakes.   The
characteristics of the soil on top of the ground and the severity of
the quake determine the amount of damage caused by vibrations.  &#147;The
important geologic factors at a[n] [earthquake] site are the (1)
softness of the rock or soil near the surface and (2) thickness of
the sediments above hard bedrock<FONT COLOR="#000000">&#148;
(</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://geopubs/"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#000000">http://geopubs</FONT></FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>).
 Lower density sediments, like sand, allow earthquake vibrations to
pass through more easily and slowly.  The slower the waves move, the
more intense the earthquake. Higher density sediments, like bedrock,
make earthquake vibrations travel faster with less intensity (Yeats,
145).  &#147;The influence of the underlying soil on the local
amplification of earthquake shaking is called the site effect&#148;
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://usgs.gov/"><FONT SIZE=3>(http://usgs.gov/</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>).
  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%">The
location of the epicenter and the soil around it determines how
destructive an earthquake will be. Earthquake intensity is the amount
of damage an earthquake causes at a specific location (Yeats, 35).
Earthquake intensity is determined by a post-earthquake survey of the
area where damage occurred, and people are asked questions about what
they felt (Yeats, 35).  The intensities of the earthquakes are
&#147;influenced by the characteristics of the ground&#148; (Yeats,
38).  One example of this is liquefaction, which is a &#147;physical
process that takes place during some earthquakes that may lead to
ground failure<FONT COLOR="#000000">&#148; (</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.es.ucsc.edu/"><FONT COLOR="#000000">http://www.es.ucsc.edu</FONT></A></U></FONT>).
 When the ground has a high content of fine grain sands and silts,
the soil acts like a liquid rather than a solid
<FONT COLOR="#000000">(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.es.ucsc.edu/"><FONT COLOR="#000000">http://www.es.ucsc.edu</FONT></A></U></FONT>).
 The pores between the sand and silt may loose strength and turn to
liquid if shaken by an earthquake (Yeats, 147).  This liquid soil is
not able to support soil or buildings on top of it
<FONT COLOR="#000000">(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.es.ucsc.edu/">http://www.es.ucsc.edu</A></U></FONT>).
 Therefore, &#147;buildings on solid rock tend to fare better (and
thus are subjected to lower intensities) then buildings on thick soft
soil&#148; (Yeats, 38).

	   The Eastern United States is in the middle of a <FONT COLOR="#000000">plate
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="file:///A|/(http://explorezone.com/"><FONT COLOR="#000000">(http://explorezone.com/</FONT></A></U></FONT>),
while the Western United States is at the very edge of a plate.  The
proximity of the plate to the edge, would appear to cause the West
have more damaging earthquakes than the East.  However, this is
untrue because soils play a very important role in how much damage is
done. Meaning, if an earthquake were to occur in the East and West at
the same exact time with the same exact magnitude, the earthquake in
the East would cause more destruction.  Experts predict that an
earthquake in the East would be more damaging because of the soft
sediment <FONT COLOR="#000000">(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://explorezone.com/"><FONT COLOR="#000000">http://explorezone.com</FONT></A></U></FONT>).
 This would cause liquefaction to be greater in the East due to
buildings in low line areas around rivers and bays
(<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://explorezone.com/"><FONT COLOR="#000000">http://explorezone.com</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">).</FONT>
 The underlying land on the West is mainly bedrock.  Due to the fact
that less sediment covers the bedrock, the land is not damaged as
much as the East, which is covered by lots of sediment.  Differences
in the sediments covering California alone prove this.  According to
the USGS website, &#147;shaking levels double from the edge of the
Los Angeles Basin, where the sediments are thin, to the middle of the
basin, where sediments reach a thickness of more than 6 kilometers (4
miles)&#148; (<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://geopubs/">http://geopubs</A></U></FONT>).
 The East, as a whole would be comparable to the center of the basin.
 The West, as a whole, would be comparable to the edges of the basin.
 This difference in the soil types is what would make the Eastern
United States have more damaging earthquakes than the Western United
States.

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>	What
is the probability of an earthquake occurring in Arkansas?  Most
people probably relate earthquakes to California or maybe Japan, but
not Arkansas.  Do not be so quick to judge.  Arkansas is one of six
states located along the New Madrid seismic zone (Jackson, 17).
During the winter of 1811-1812, three of the largest earthquakes in
North American history occurred along this region, all of which had
magnitudes greater than 8.0 on the Richter scale (Stewart and Knox,
19).  Since the installation of seismic instruments along the New
Madrid region, it has become known that earthquakes happen all the
time in the mid-south.  Out of the total 150 earthquakes per year,
many are too small to be felt by people
(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/public/"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#000000">www.ceri.memphis.edu/public/</FONT></FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>).
 The probability of an earthquake <FONT COLOR="#000000">with</FONT> a
magnitude of 8.0 occurring in Arkansas in the next 15 years is less
than 1%  <FONT COLOR="#000000">(</FONT></FONT><A HREF="http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/public/"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#000000">www.ceri.memphis.edu/public/</FONT></FONT></A><FONT SIZE=3>).
 An earthquake with the magnitude 6.0 occurring within the next 15
years has a probability of 63% (</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/public/"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#000000">www.ceri.memphis.edu/public/</FONT></FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>).
           &#147;The possibility of a great earthquake happening soon
in the New Madrid seismic zone is small.  Scientists believe that
catastrophic events like those of the 1811-12 happen in the New
Madrid region every 550-1200 years&#148;
(</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/public/"><FONT SIZE=3>www.ceri.memphis.edu/public/</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>).
           </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>The
type of soil located within a particular region determines the amount
of damage caused by an earthquake, and Arkansas contains mainly
sedimentary rocks with also some igneous rocks.  Sedimentary rock is
classified as being either clastic (rocks made up of grains of sand,
silt, and clay) or chemical (rocks made up of shell fragments, saline
water deposits, and other materials deposited from solution). 
Illustration VIII, which is a cross section of a portion of Arkansas,
shows that bedrock can be found almost a half-mile below the surface.
 Therefore, earthquakes in Arkansas would be comparable to those in
the East.   </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, earthquakes are greatly influenced by the soil
surrounding the epicenter of a region.  The differences in the soil
types of the East and West United States vary greatly.  The East
contains bedrock covered by large amounts of sediment, whereas, the
West is primarily bedrock.  Therefore, earthquakes in the East would
tend to be more devastating than those in the West. Surprisingly,
Arkansas, which is a state not known for its earthquake activity, has
many that occur but are never felt. The probability of an earthquake
occurring in Arkansas is small, but due to the soil coverage, the
earthquake could be quite devastating.</FONT></P>
