<P>&quot;Mortality Rates in Arkansas&quot;</P>

<P>What are the main causes of death in Arkansas?</P>
<P>If there is one constant in this universe, it is that we will all eventually die.  Everybody wonders about his or her death.  They wonder if they will pass on surrounded by their children or grandchildren, or if they will be alone.  They wonder if they will go peacefully or if the end will be slow and painful.  They even wonder how old they will be when their &quot;time comes.&quot;  We have compiled information from several sources, in the hopes of answering the riddle, &quot;How will I die?&quot;</P>
<P>The 1996 United States crude death rate was 875.4 deaths per 100,000 people.  Arkansas, in comparison, reached 1,099.1 deaths, which was 25.6 higher than the national average.  However, when these rates were age adjusted, Arkansas registered only 13.3% higher than the U. S. rate.  Twelve thousand eight hundred ninety of Arkansas’ 26,526 resident deaths were females.  Thirteen thousand six hundred thirty six of the total resident deaths were males.  Eighty five percent of these deaths were among the white population and the remaining fifteen percent were among non-whites, most of which were black.</P>
<P>Arkansas’ four leading causes of death for both whites and non-whites in 1996 were heart disease (31.3%), malignant neoplasms (22.5%), cerebrovascular diseases (8.6%), and accidents and adverse effects (4.8%).  </P>
<P>These deaths were also divided according to the six &quot;Stages of Life.&quot;  The first of these divisions was infancy.  The greatest risk of death occurs during the first year of life.  Respiratory conditions and distress, disorders related to short gestation, and low birth weight accounted for the majority of infant deaths.  Congenital abnormalities, sudden infant death syndrome, accidents, and pneumonia followed these.  During 1996, Arkansas had 337 infant deaths, which was 4.3% of the total deaths in the state.  Although variations between the races exist, white and non-whites were combined to form the infant mortality rate.</P>
<P>Thanks to vaccinations and antibiotics, the leading cause of death during childhood is no longer fatal infectious disease.  &quot;Accidents and adverse effects&quot; accounted for the majority of deaths in white and non-white children between the ages 1 and 14.  There was little racial difference at this stage in life except that HIV had risen among blacks and Hispanics.</P>
<P>During young adulthood, ages 15-24, racial differences begin to segregate causes of death.  Although violence and/or accidents, homicide, and suicide accounted for the majority of deaths, the frequency varied among races.  Homicide and legal intervention lead the cause of deaths for non-whites and accidents and adverse effects accounted for the majority of white male deaths.  </P>
<P>The maturing years gave rise to gender, racial, and ethnic differences.  Until this stage of life, cause of death was similar between the genders.  Now cancer became the major cause of death followed by heart disease.  Black males carried the highest death rate and white females carried the lowest.  Malignant neoplasms (cancer) were the leading cause of death for females between the ages of 25 and 44.  Accidents and adverse effects remained the leading cause for deaths of males.  The ending of the maturing years, ages 45-64, brought no change in cause of death for women, but we finally see a difference for the males.  Cancer and heart disease as the leading cause of death surpassed accidents and adverse effects.</P>
<P>The mortality rate increased during seniority, years 65 and older.  Obviously, cancer and heart disease are the major causes of death.  However, an essential fact is that heart disease greatly surpassed cancer in senior deaths.  Heart disease claimed 34.9% while cancer was responsible for 21.2% of the deaths.</P>
<P>Morbidity greatly increased for the old age bracket due to rising rates of the causes seen in seniority.  Many of the elderly, 85 and older, suffer from arthritis and approximately 1/3 suffer from vision or hearing impairment.  The average age of death is rising but the average period spent disabled may be increasing also.</P> <hr>
