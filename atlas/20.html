mantle, are fluid enough to move slowly in the convection current driven by
heat stored in the Earth’s core.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
motion of the mantle causes Earth’s crust to move in pieces called tectonic
plates (Bergman &amp; Renwich 1999:91).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In 1968, W. Jason Morgan introduced the concept of plate tectonics in
which the Earth’s crust is considered to be divided into a series of rigid
plates bounded by mid-oceanic ridges, oceanic trenches, great faults, and
active fold belts (Seyfert &amp; Sirkin 1973:12).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The theory of plate tectonics describes the horizontal surface
movement of large, continent-sized slabs which explains how the outer shell of
the Earth is divided into a small number of vast pieces, called plates (Lamb
&amp; Sington 1998:8).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The plates are
constantly moving, relative to each other, over the surface of the earth;
sometimes at divergent boundaries, moving apart at the mid-oceanic ridges;
sometimes moving past each other along transform faults; and sometimes moving
together at converging boundaries (Lamb &amp; Sington 1998:79).<span

Conway is not located exactly on the New Madrid fault the concerns of this
particular area are based around seismic vibrations.<span style="mso-spacerun:

releases in the form of seismic vibrations more energy than a 100-megaton
bomb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These vibrations form waves which
spread out from the source of the earthquake like ripples in a pond (Lamb &amp;
Sington 1998:94).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These waves cause
characteristic ground shaking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There
are very few clues on the Earth’s surface as to what really causes earthquakes
along the New Madrid Seismic Zone due to years of sediment layers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Far beneath these sediment layers
geophysicists have found an extraordinary feature known as the Reelfoot Rift.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The majority of earthquakes along this fault
occur within this structure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It has
been estimated that this rift was formed more than five hundred million years
ago (http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/QUAKES/FactSheets/HiddenHazs/, 9/20/00).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A rift structure is created when powerful
geologic forces begin to pull the Earth’s<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>crust apart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If this process
continues long enough, the crust separates to form an ocean basin, as happened
to form the Atlantic Ocean basin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
Reelfoot Rift is called a failed rift because the Earth’s crust did not
separate enough to create a new ocean basin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, the crust was disturbed enough to form major faults that mark
the axis and margins of the rift and now contribute to the occurrence of
earthquakes in the [New Madrid Seismic Zone]
(http://quake.wr.usgs.gov./QUAKES/FactSheets/HiddenHazs/, 9/20/00).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although this rift is often referred to as
&quot;inactive&quot;, it greatly influences central regions of the US

of Arkansas is noted for relatively light-intensity shocks felt over extremely
large areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 1811-1812 great shocks
that occurred in the New Madrid seismic zone seriously affected the northeast
section of Arkansas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These shocks were
some of the largest in the United States since its settlement by
Europeans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Arkansas’s 40-mile-long,

Oklahoma.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It not only shook houses
strongly at Fort Smith but also was felt about 135,000 miles away.<span

Arkansas and in adjacent states.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From
1921 to 1933, two earthquakes reaching intensity five on the Richter scale
alarmed much of the populations of Pocahontas and Little Rock.<span

both were felt over 30,000 square mile areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Few earthquakes are centered in southwestern Arkansas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a damaging quake did occur in June
1939, northeastern residents were awakened on January 25, 1955 by the sounds of
walls and ceilings cracking due to an earthquake covering 30,000 square
miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After being seismically tranquil
for 14 years a tremor centered about 19 miles northwest of Little Rock took
place on January 1, 1969.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The effects
of cracked plaster, moved furniture and swaying trees were recorded in southern
Missouri and western Tennessee (Zirbes 2000: http://www.usgs.gov/).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Blytheville. Earthquake intensity is measured on a 0-to-9 logarithmic device
called the Richter scale that records the earthquake’s seismic waves.<span

damages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 1996 earthquake in
Blytheville affected five states with no serious damage reported.<span

damage (UALR 1998: http://quake.ualr.edu/).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

the fact that earthquakes do not happen only in the western part of the United
States, should the city of Conway fear them?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

following quote:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>&quot;Scientists
estimate that the probability of a magnitude 6 to 7 earthquake occurring in
this seismic zone within the next 50 years is higher than 90%&quot;(USGS). With
all the damage that earthquakes cause, residents of all areas should have the
need to prepare themselves for earthquakes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>That quote, taken from the United States Geological Survey, is talking
about the Mississippi Valley Region which is very close to Conway.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If this holds true, people and residents of
Conway might want to prepare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A way of
going about this preparation would be earthquake insurance or what is called
earthquake coverage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Arkansas Act
1343 of 1999 was aimed at making earthquake insurance more available, and
discussed revisions to the state earthquake building code(USGS).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This act obviously affects how insurance
companies go about their earthquake insurance policies.<span

specifically asked for?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second was:
How much approximately does it cost to add earthquake coverage?<span

answered that under a new homeowners law, earthquake insurance or coverage must
be offered by agents when dealing with their clients.<span style="mso-spacerun:

the third question she said in her own opinion a small percent of about 10%
might carry<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>earthquake insurance in the

Insurance of Conway, AR.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In regard to
the first question, Mr. Wallace said earthquake insurance is offered and the
majority of people turn it down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He
stated that if one turns it down, they must sign an exclusion stating that they
turned the insurance coverage down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>When faced with the next question of how much it costs to add earthquake
coverage, he thought it through and gave me a close figure.<span

house costing $100,000, it would cost $104 a year.<span style="mso-spacerun:

deductible plays a role too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The third
question dealt with people carrying the insurance, and Mr. Wallace said he only
has about one in twenty customers carry it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The last question about earthquake coverage being a necessity or a
precaution made him chuckle a little.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Mr. Wallace said very few take it and he stated something very
interesting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He said that no one in
their particular office, or that worked for the company carries earthquake
insurance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I found this very odd

earthquakes of a 6 to 7 magnitude on the Richter scale, and the majority of the
population of Conway see no need for the extra coverage.<span
