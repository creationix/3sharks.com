<P CLASS="msonormal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the 1980s the growth of gated communities sky rocketed. Gated
communities is where they &#147;control their social environments as
well-ultimately trying to create whole neighborhoods of people of the
same age, profession, sexual orientation, religion or even ethnic
origin&#148; (Nelson 222). Gated communities are not a new idea. The
theory has been used since the armies and the city-states of the
past, like the dark ages, realized a wall around the area they lived
would help to repel invaders (http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb). People
built fortresses such as Megiddo in the 500 B.C.E (Buckler 41).&#160;
The theory is sound, but is it applicable to today&#146;s
neighborhoods? This is the question that has been asked over the
years. The answer is different for everyone. In general most people
that will move or already live in these types of habitats do so
because they feel safer (Tucker 24). Our research question is are
gated communities the modern day fort?&#160; In this report we will
look at why people move to gated communities, the three types of
gated communities, and the effects that gated communities have on
non-gated community residents.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="line-height: 200%">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The wealthy citizens of this country have historically wanted gates
and walls around their estates (Waxler 438). This kept them socially
isolated from the more common or lower class people. The same can be
said about the higher classes of today. It is not common for a person
of wealth to live in a home that is not protected by a gate. Another
reason for gated communities is the idea that it keeps your property
safe from those that might want to take it from you. It is almost
like the city-states of the past looking for protection (Baron 93).</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Is this protection from criminals a realistic
idea? The answer to the question is no. These gates and fences are
not that much of a deterrent for criminals. If a criminal wants
something then they will find a way to get it. Another aspect for
people to look at is the fact that &#147; police have reported that
crime was as likely to come from people living within the gates as
from outside.&#148; (Tucker 22). The gated communities give many
people a &#147;false sense of security&#148;. If you look at most of
these areas of safety you will see that most of the walls do not go
completely around the complex (see Figure 7).&#160;&#160; Homeowners
are also attracted to gated communities because the property values
are higher. This is a way that the realtor feeds on the ignorance of
the customer that wants to buy a home they believe is protected
(Baron 95).</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="line-height: 200%">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are three types of gated communities in the United States
(Tucker 23).&#160; The first type is the life style community (see
figures 1 and 2). This type of community is typical of the
retirement, golf, and leisure communities. These types of leisure
activities are the common bonds on which the community is
established.&#160; The walls around these areas give the residents a
sense of separation from the outside world so they can relax and
enjoy life. These types of communities are becoming popular with the
upper middle class (Tucker 24).</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="line-height: 200%">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This brings us to prestige communities (see figures 3 and 4). They
are the homes of the rich and famous. Areas such as these tend to
show off the status of the inhabitants. It is a barrier between the
upper class and the lower classes. These borders help to feed the
dislike of the affluent by those of the lower classes.&#160; The
walls also allow the realtor to charge a higher price for the home
(Tucker 23).&#160; We looked through a reality magazine of homes in
Arkansas and we found that homes in gated communities were listed for
$300-$400 thousand dollars where as homes of the same equivalent but
not in gated communities were around $200 thousand dollars (The
Original Homes Magazine).&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="line-height: 200%">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The third type and perhaps the most popular is the security-zone
community (see figures 5 and 6). This is where groups of people get
together for the purpose of segregating themselves from their
neighbors. They do this for protection and an added sense of
security, hence, the name security-zone community. You will find
these communities located in the inner-city and lower-income areas
(Tucker 23).</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="line-height: 200%">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The affects of these communities can be felt from outside of the
gates as well as inside. If we as a society want to bring everyone
together geographically with no thought of income or race, then we
have a long way to go. These gated 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="line-height: 200%">&nbsp;communities are
a major set back. Most of these communities handle all of their
street maintenance, garbage collecting, and security. This makes the
lower income citizens more dependent on the city for such help.
Without the help of the rich and powerful to keep such luxuries in
place, then the lower class might lose this as well
(http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb). This is a clear case of the people
that have the power taking every advantage they have. These people
want to distance themselves from the poor so they can feel better
about themselves. The walls represent the thin line that is between
them and poverty. The walls also keep them ignorant of how poor some
people really are. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">When it comes to forts, which is a military
installation that holds a particular piece of ground, the militaries
of the past and present are the true masters. This is their job. They
have to keep the land that they have taken theirs. The best way to do
this is to put up walls and guard these walls (FM 7-8). 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="line-height: 200%">Is this the way we
want our neighborhoods set up? If so then we want to live the future
that most science fiction holds for us. If this happens then we might
have city&#146;s set up where everyone is separated (Davis 253). 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Gated communities are the modern day fortresses.
In the end there will always be those whom are affluent and those
whom are not.&#160; These affluent will always be in power. This is
what history has taught us. The people with the 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="line-height: 200%">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Power, i.e. the people with the money, control the
access to their land. If the affluent want there to be more equality,
then they will have to get rid of gated communities that serve the
purpose of segregation. Of course, there are always exceptions to the
rule. An example would be the military. Most of these 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>communities will have to open their gates. They do not
provide protection like one might think, and they affect the outside
community in a negative manner.&#160; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>They just do not work unless you do not want people of
a different social class around.&#160;
