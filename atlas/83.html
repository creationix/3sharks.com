<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 1in">&#147;The
first folk music was probably just a rhythm, a repetition of sounds
by early man.  One tribe may have had this genuinely grooooovie
member who instead of saying &#147;Oohg&#148; when he pointed or
grabbed at something started saying &#147;Oohg-a-doog.&#148;  &#147;Far
out!&#148;  said the rest of the tribe, and pretty soon, like all
good songs, it caught on, one tribesman passing it on to another, to
the point where someone from the next tribe over the hill picked it
up.  When he came home that night and tried it on his wife, she
probably bopped him on the head and said the equivalent of &#147;Where
did you learn that crazy riff?&#148;  Her husband probably replied,
&#147;Oh, it&#146;s just a song the folks over the hill were
singing.&#148;  Songs of the folks.  Folk song.</P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal; line-height: 200%">Folk
music has very distinct characteristics and plays a large role in
revealing the heritages of various groups of people.  Folk music is
defined as &#147;songs that truly express the hopes, fears, cares,
concerns, and styles of living of a people&#148; (Horst, 4).  There
are many types of folk music because of the various cultures all over
the world.  The different types of folk traditions in the United
States have been brought here from different countries (Knott, File
2)<B>.</B> The history of folk music began with the first settlers
from Europe and eventually diffused to the rest of the United States.
 The type of folk music that has had the largest impact on Arkansas
is American folk music.  Jimmy Driftwood, who is known as the Father
of Folk Music, was born and raised in Arkansas.  &#147;He came up
with the idea for the Ozark Folk Center at Mountain View and helped
establish the annual Ozark Folk Festival&#148;
(http://www.findarticles .com).    
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal; line-height: 200%">Folk
music tells about the various experiences that different people have,
which is why there are so many diverse types of folk music (Forcucci,
16).  American folk music is comprised of different types of songs. 
For example, some songs are about the Civil War (Randolph, 199). 
Most people of the Ozarks have a lack of interest in talking about
these songs due to the memories that are accompanied with them
(Randolph, 200).  This shows how closely related the songs are to the
experiences and feelings of the people.  Another type of song is the
American Indian Song.  &#147;In any discussion of American folk music
it would be unfair to omit the music of the American Indian, even
though (in the final analysis) it did not play a significant role in
determining the way of American folk music&#148; (Forcucci, 31).  The
colonists were intrigued by the music of the Indians, but considered
their own more advanced (Forcucci, 31).  Indian song was passed down
from father to son (Horst, 8).  A third type of song is work songs. 
During Colonial times, people were constantly traveling and building
new homes (Horst, 12).  &#147;They sang with the rhythm of their work
to help them with their labors or to while away the time on their
job&#148; (Horst, 13).  Folk music has proved to be influential in
modern times.  In the 1960&#146;s, social change caused Civil Rights
leaders to turn to folk music to express their feelings (Ferris,
viii).  &#147;The folk music revival of the sixties also established
a commercial market for protest folk singers such as Joan Baez and
Bob Dylan&#148; (Ferris, viii).  There are many different types of
American folk music.  Some more examples are: Sea Chanties, Ballads,
Spirituals, Blues, Pioneer Songs, and Western Music.  Out of these
various types of songs, the religious hymns had the largest impact on
Folk Music (Horst, 12-17).  Map I shows the diffusion of Protestant
Religious Folk Songs throughout the United States. (See Appendix.)</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>
The diffusion of folk music has been possible due to the oral
tradition.  Oral tradition means that music is passed on from
generation to generation by word of mouth (Sandberg, ix).  American
folk music is a combination of British and Irish tunes (Nettl, 201). 
It has changed with American history and the development of American
culture (Nettl, 201).  &#147;The frontier, the religious revival of
the 1800s, the love of humor and exaggeration, the presence of
various ethnic minorities, and the particular occupations in which
Americans had to engage while building a new country&#148;,
influenced the development of American folk music (Nettl, 201).  In
order to understand the movement of folk music to Arkansas, some
geographic terms need to be explained.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>One
term that should be defined is <I>friction of distance.  Friction of
distance</I> is the effort or cost required for ideas to travel from
one place to another (Bergman and Renwick, 17).  Illustration I shows
the friction of distance through an isotopic plain.  (See Appendix.) 
The friction of distance remains constant throughout.  The friction
of distance for folk music was the effort to spatially diffuse from
Europe and other countries to and throughout the United States. 
Since there was a lack of transportation during the seventeenth
century the friction of distance was high. &#147;The
seventeenth-century Antiquary John Aubrey once remarked that  &#145;before
women were readers, the history of England was handed down from
mother to daughter&#133;&#146;&#148; (Hudson, 20).  If it were not
for the parents&#146; efforts to pass on traditions of their
cultures, folk music would not have survived.  The children use these
songs to reflect on the history of past generations (Jackson, 269). 
With the advancement of transportation technology, such as airplanes,
automobiles, and trains, the friction of distance was lowered. This
made the diffusion of folk music easier.  Communication technology,
such as radios, the Internet, and recorded materials, also played a
key role in the spread of folk music.  These communication devices
made folk music more accessible to a wider variety of people.  Books
were also an improvement in communications technology.  They were
used to record the stories of past cultures.  In order for folk music
to spread to the rest of America, the travelers had to put forth the
effort and money to move and create homes for themselves and their
families, which is an example of relocation diffusion.  Relocation
diffusion is when someone moves to a new location and takes their
culture, customs, foods, etc&#133;with them (Cossman).  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Another
term that should be explained is <I>diffusion.  Diffusion</I> is the
spread of different aspects of a culture from where they originate to
other places (Bergman and Renwick, 203).  There are three types of
diffusion (Cossman).  Relocation diffusion and contagious diffusion
are shown in Illustration II.  (See Appendix.)  Contagious diffusion
is passed when groups of people are close to one another and interact
(Cossman).  An example would be a drop of wine on a cloth (Gould,
93).  The wine slowly spreads from where it was dropped throughout
the rest of the cloth (Gould, 93). Folk music was passed from
generation to generation by contagious diffusion.  Hierarchical
diffusion occurs when culture, customs, foods, etc&#133;pass by
jumping from one place to another (Gould, 93).  An example would be
the diffusion of fashion from New York to larger cities and then
neighboring smaller cities (Gould, 93).  Folk music was spread when
the colonists moved to other regions of the United States.  Diffusion
does not always explain the exact origin of an idea or aspect because
the idea could have originated in two different locations at the same
exact time (Bergman and Renwick, 206).  This explains the various
types of folk music in the world today.  The world contains many
diverse cultures.  Many of these cultures have folk music that
probably originated around the same time period.  These types of folk
music are very different from each other due to the fact that the
people are telling stories about the culture that they come from
(Horst, 5).  The songs that came to the United States from other
cultures traveled with the people and were even created along the way
(Lomax, vii).  &#147;Folk music came by ship with settlers from
England, France, Spain, and all of the seafaring nations that
colonized America in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries&#148;
(Horst, 6).  Many of the settlers came to the United States in search
of religious freedom (Horst, 9). </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal; line-height: 200%">
Folk music in the United States was first brought over by a group of
Anglo-Saxons who were also known as Pilgrims (Forcucci, 25).  &#147;The
Pilgrims were a religious group who had separated from the Church of
England in order to pursue their own method of worship&#148;
(Forcucci, 25).  The Pilgrims songs were derived from the Bible
(Forcucci, 25).  Along with their songs of worship, the Pilgrims also
sang during their leisure time (Forcucci, 29).  The Anglo-Saxons&#146;
songs had an enormous influence on folk music (Forcucci, 30).  As the
settlers moved throughout the United States (relocation and
contagious diffusion), they carried their folk music with them.

<FONT SIZE=3>	 The movement of folk music throughout the United
States began in the 1700&#146;s, traveling &#147;down&#148; the
Appalachian Mountains, then West and South (Bergman and Renwick 209).
 Folk music reached the state of Arkansas around the late 1800&#146;s
(Bergman and Renwick 209). The primary region of Arkansas known for
folk music is the Ozarks.  The Ozark region is shown in Map II.  (See
Appendix.)  Folk music is a major aspect of the Ozark culture.  The
Ozarks are known for its &#147;deep affection for its folk music and
how the music has helped shape the character of the area&#148;
(Carney, 41).  The Ozarks produced a famous folk musician by the name
of Jimmy Driftwood.  He was born on June 20, 1917, in Mountain View,
Arkansas.  &#147;He gained his background in the music naturally from
his upbringing in the Ozark Mountains (Stambler and Landon, 85).  He
received a B. S. in education from Arkansas State Teachers College in
Conway in the early 1940s (Stambler and Landon, 85).   He started his
musical career playing at dances, picnics, and other events during
his spare time.   During his musical career he wrote around 6,000
folk songs and 300 were published or recorded
(http://www.findarticles.com/).  Driftwood went on to perform with
the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tenn., and on stages across the
United States and Europe (http://www.findarticles.com/).  Though he
loved traveling and performing, he spent most of his life at the
family farm, just west of Mountain View in North Arkansas&#146; Ozark
Mountains.        </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>Jimmy
Driftwood established both the Ozark Folk Center at Mountain View and
the Ozark Folk Festival (http://www.findarticles.com).  Ozark folk
festival sites are shown in Map III.  Map IV shows the route from
Conway to Mountain View.  (See Appendix.)  Starting in 1963, the
Ozark Folk Festival is held in April every year.  The main goal of
the festival is to preserve the folk music heritage of the region. 
They use specific instruments such as &#147;bass fiddles and drums&#148;
which pertain to the origin of folk music (Stambler and Landon, 11). 
Through the success of the Arkansas Folk Festival in 1966, Congress
awarded approximately 1.4 million dollars for the development of the
Folk Cultural Center of America located in Mountain View (Stambler
and Landon, 11).  </FONT>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>&#147;Driftwood
and his wife, Cleda, opened the Driftwood Barn near Mountain View to
give him a permanent place to perform on weekends.  He never charged
admission but did pass the hat to help cover expenses&#148;
(http://www.findarticles.com).  The barn was deeded to Arkansas State
Teachers College, now the University of Central Arkansas, Conway,
with the understanding that students would be able to study the
history of folk music (http://www.findarticles.com).  UCA no longer
owns the barn. It is now deeded to the Racken Sack.  The UCA Archives
also contains the entire Jimmy Driftwood collection.  Jimmy Driftwood
died at the age of 91 in Fayetteville, Ar.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; font-style: normal; line-height: 200%"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, the many different types of people who have come to live
in America have influenced American folk music.  The diffusion of
folk music from Europe to the United States and then throughout the
United States was a long process due to the friction of distance. 
Folk music has, in many ways, shaped the way that people look at
their heritage.  Folk music tells about the past experiences of
people and offers a look into their way of life.</FONT></P>
