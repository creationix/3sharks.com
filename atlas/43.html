<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The focus of this project will be
isolated to a region of Arkansas known as the bottomlands and terraces of
eastern Arkansas (See attached map 1b). These terraces begin near Pulaski
County and spread eastward to the eastern borders of our state. Small areas
such as these are found in the southwestern part of Arkansas near the Red River
and in central Arkansas near the Arkansas River. This region is approximately
7,300,000 acres(United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation
Service 1982: Map). The soil of this area is composed of alluvium. Alluvium is
soil material, such as sand, silt, or clay, deposited by flowing water (United
States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service 1975:63). In
eastern Arkansas, alluvium is deposited in formations known as terraces (See
attached diagram 1c). Terraces are geological formations above flood plains
that are formed by flowing water (Greta Haustein, Sept. 29,1999). They are old
alluvial plains, usually flat or with small ridges. Terraces are always near
rivers or lakes. Eastern Arkansas exemplifies the phenomena of terrace
formation well. This region is a flood plain known as the Mississippi River
Delta. The waters of the Mississippi and its tributaries flooded in this area
leaving behind terrace formations. The bottomlands and terraces are prime
examples of geological land formation by water and soil (United States Department
of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service 1975:65). The soil is carried in the
form of silt and deposited by the rivers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The bottomlands and terraces consist
of alluvial plains and low terraces. Elevations of these areas range from 100
to 400 feet above sea level. The soils in these areas are a mixture of deep
clayey, loamy, or sandy alluvial sediments (United States Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service 1982:Map). Clay and sand are categorized
by size. Clay is the smallest of all soil particles, while sand is the largest
of all soil particles. Clay settles slower in water because of its weight;
likewise, sand settles the fastest. Loam is nutrient rich sediment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The topography or terrain of a
region affects the way in which sediment is deposited. “Differences in slope
determines the amount of runoff water as well as the degree of erosion and
sedimentation that takes place” (Beyrouty, Hanson, Slaton 1996:20). The
topography of this area helps<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>induce
the formation of terraces and flood plains. The slope of the land encourages
certain formations to form when water is present. Certain conditions have to be
just right to produce terraces and flood plains. Due to its location near major
rivers these areas have been historically subject to flooding and production of
terraces. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The flooding of the bottomlands
makes the land useful for agricultural purposes. If this flooding process is
stopped, not only are the natural formations lost but we also lose the
replenishment of fertile soil. The Mississippi River dumps nutrient rich
sediments on this land during floods. Without floods, farming would not be as
fruitful in the bottomlands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The soils of the bottomlands and
terraces are important in agricultural production. Most of these areas are used
for crop land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Important crops include
cotton, grain sorghum, rice, soybeans, and wheat. A few areas are also used for
pasture and hay land” (United States Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service 1982: Map). Some of these areas are still hardwood forests
supporting timber production and wildlife habitat (United States Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service 1982: Map). These areas are slightly to
moderately limited<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>for urban usage.
Many areas are subject to flooding (United States Department of Agriculture,
Soil Conservation Service 1975:11). These areas are limited for urban usage
because of the flood rates. When flood plains are inhabited, the government
steps in to protect property. In doing this they are preventing soil productivity.
Septic tank absorption fields are also limited in some of these areas (United
States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service 1975:8).The soil in
this area<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is saturated frequently<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>and doesn’t hold additional moisture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There are several different soil
types in the bottomlands and terraces. These differing soil types and locations
illustrate the relationship between the formation of certain land forms and the
deposited sediments in the area. This depositing of soils by flood waters in specific
areas creates our agricultural regions of today. Specific crops grow better in
certain areas due to the nutrients that are prevalent there. (See attached
chart 1a)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Erosion is a major problem facing
farmlands in the United States such as these found in the Mississippi Delta.
“Erosion is the wearing away of the soil by water, wind, and other forces..
Water causes about two-thirds of the erosion on our agricultural land”(United
States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service 1987:3). Erosion is
not all bad. “River Valleys for example, are fertile because of eons of
geologic erosion from the highlands” (United States Department of Agriculture,
Soil Conservation Service 1987:7). The type of erosion we should avoid in the
bottomlands and terraces is called accelerated erosion. We cause accelerated
erosion by clearing meadows to grow crops and exposing the soil to the forces
of nature (United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service
1987:7). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The types of accelerated erosion caused
by water are splash erosion, sheet erosion,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>rill erosion, concentrated-flow erosion, gully erosion, and mass
erosion. Splash erosion happens when the plant life that covers and protects
the land is no longer present. Water droplets hit the bare land and displace
soil, causing it to be carried by water. Sheet erosion occurs on hillsides when
rain fall deposits the soil from the top of the hill at the bottom of the hill.
Rill erosion is also prevalent on hillsides. Rill erosion is characterized by
small dips, or rills, carved out in the soil. Concentrated flow erosion looks
much like to a small water fall or creek when it rains. The soil is carried
away by a small source of flowing water. Gully erosion is a larger versions of
concentrated flow erosion. The differences between concentrated flow and gully
erosion are the resulting formations. Gully erosion forms deep ditch like
formations, while concentrated flow forms smaller creek bed like formations
(Margolin, Malcom 1975:66)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

productive. Loss of topsoil can cause soil to have a lower capacity to hold
water. Erosion can cause the loss of organic matter and nutrients in soil.

erosion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
